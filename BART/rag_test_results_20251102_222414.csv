2,"I'm a transferee from another uni, what papers do I need?","Transferees must submit their Transcript of Records or Certification of Grades, a Certification of Good Moral Character, a satisfactory result from the Dean's assessment, a recommendation from the Dean or Guidance Counselor of their previous school, a Transfer Credential/Honorable Dismissal, their EARISTCAT result, and a medical/health examination.","Based on the provided handbook sections, you would need to provide a copy of your current and previous Certificate of Registration (COR) and a copy of your current and previous Report of Grades. Additionally, you may need to submit these documents to the Department Chairperson and the Registrar's Office for evaluation if you wish to transfer credits from your previous school. If you plan to follow the old curriculum, you do not need to take the Bridging Program for Lifelong Learners. However, if you plan to follow the new curriculum, you will be required to enroll and pass the additional general education subjects identified in the Bridging Program for Lifelong Learners. Finally, you will need to file an application for graduation to the Registrar's Office and satisfy all academic and other requirements prescribed by the Institute in order to be recommended for graduation.",easy,paraphrased,10.5,0.5097,0.4426,5,"[36, 30, 68, 42, 242]"
3,My EARISTCAT score for BS Civil Engineering was 82%. Did I get in?,"No, the minimum score for admission to BSCE is 85.00%. A score of 82% would put you in the 'Waitlisted' category, which ranges from 50.00% to 79.99%.","Based on the provided handbook sections, the EARISTCAT score requirement for admission into the Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering program is 85%. Since your EARISTCAT score is 82%, you would not have been admitted into the program. However, if you meet the other admission requirements and pass the College Admission Interview and Program Preparedness Test, you may still be considered for admission into the program.",medium,scenario,10.38,0.4672,0.4489,5,"[27, 85, 28, 25, 29]"
4,"Admission is first-come-first-served, right? So my EARISTCAT score doesn't really matter?","This is incorrect. While admission is on a first-come-first-served basis, the EARISTCAT result is a mandatory admission requirement for both freshmen and transferees, and your score determines if you are admitted, waitlisted, or need realignment.","Based on the provided handbook sections, it appears that admission to EARIST is not strictly first-come, first-served. Instead, there are several levels of screening that must be completed before an applicant can be accepted into the Institute.

Firstly, all applicants must take the EARIST College Admission Test (EARISTCAT) and achieve a certain score in order to be considered for admission. The exact score required varies depending on the program, but generally, it ranges from 70% to 85%.

Once an applicant has passed the EARISTCAT, they will move on to the next level of screening, which is the College Admission Interview. This interview is conducted by the chairperson or a faculty member of the program the applicant is applying for, and it evaluates the student's leadership potential, determination and perseverance, career choice, and communication skills. For architecture and fine arts applicants, a Drawing Ability Test (DAT) will also be conducted as part of the screening process.

After passing both the EARISTCAT and the College Admission Interview, an applicant may still need to undergo additional screening, such as an Enhancement Program if their EARISTCAT score is below the required threshold for their chosen program.

It's important to note that admission to EARIST is not guaranteed, even if an applicant has passed all the necessary screenings. The final decision on an applicant's admission will be based on the table provided in the handbook, which outlines the cut-off scores and waitlist percentages for each program.",medium,adversarial,79.45,0.6003,0.5166,5,"[25, 27, 36, 29, 85]"
5,What's the deadline for freshman applications for the next school year?,NOT ANSWERABLE FROM HANDBOOK,"Based on the provided handbook sections, there is no specific deadline mentioned for freshman applications for the next school year. However, it is stated that all Grade 12 graduates are eligible to apply for admission in EARIST. Therefore, the deadline for freshman applications would likely be the same as the deadline for Grade 12 graduations in the respective country or region. It is recommended to check with the specific institution or school board for the exact date of Grade 12 graduations and the corresponding application deadlines.",easy,unanswerable,6.47,0.4891,0.4498,5,"[227, 25, 223, 27, 66]"
6,I'm applying for BS Architecture. Is there any other test besides the main entrance exam?,"Yes, applicants for Architecture and Fine Arts must take a Drawing Ability Test (DAT) as part of their screening process.","Based on the provided handbook sections, it appears that there is no additional test required for admission into the Bachelor of Science in Architecture program beyond the main entrance exam, which is the EARIST College Admission Test (EARISTCAT). However, it should be noted that the handbook does not provide specific details regarding the content or format of the EARISTCAT exam. If you have further questions or concerns, I would recommend reaching out to the relevant offices or individuals within the university for more information.",medium,scenario,11.4,0.5652,0.4955,5,"[28, 27, 29, 85, 25]"
7,What's the maximum number of units I can enroll in per semester?,The maximum academic load for undergraduate students is the number of units specified in the program checklist for that term.,"Based on the provided handbook sections, the maximum number of units a student can enroll in per semester depends on several factors. For regular terms, the maximum academic units for undergraduate students is the number of units indicated on the program checklist. However, a student may be allowed to enroll more than the maximum allowable load during a regular term under certain conditions. These conditions include that the overload does not exceed 6 units over and above the regular load, the overload courses are back courses in their curriculum checklist and/or courses without pre-requisites, and the overload courses are recommended by the Dean/Campus Administrator and approved by the Vice President for Academic Affairs.

For the intersession class, the regular academic load is 6 units. A student may be allowed to enroll additional three (3) units under the following conditions: the courses are back courses in their curriculum checklist and/or courses without pre-requisites.

It's important to note that there are restrictions on the number of units that can be enrolled for major and minor courses. These courses cannot have their training outside of the school except in specialized programs provided the schedule of the enrolled subjects are outside the training hours. In such a case, the student shall accomplish SARRMS form.",easy,direct,15.3,0.6293,0.5101,5,"[34, 84, 85, 49, 83]"
8,"I'm a regular student, can I enroll in just 6 units this semester because I have a part-time job?","No, students are not allowed to carry less than one-half of the regular load. Exceptions are made only if you have academic deficiencies, are a graduating student, or if your required courses are not offered that semester.","Based on the provided handbook sections, a regular student cannot enroll in just 6 units this semester simply because they have a part-time job. According to Section 2.1 of the handbook, a student shall carry the regular load every semester as prescribed in the curricular program. This means that a student must carry the minimum academic load of 18 units (except for graduating students) as stated in Section 2.3. Additionally, dropping any subject, shifting courses, or stopping from schooling without the approval of the Dean and the Registrar is prohibited according to Sections 4 and 5. Therefore, a student who wishes to enroll in fewer than 18 units must obtain approval from the Dean and the Registrar before doing so.",medium,scenario,9.55,0.6045,0.4807,5,"[34, 84, 85, 90, 79]"
9,Can I enroll in two different colleges at EARIST at the same time to get two degrees?,"No, the handbook states that no student shall be enrolled in more than one college to earn more than one academic degree at the same time.","Based on the provided handbook sections, it is not possible for a student to enroll in two different colleges at EARIST at the same time to obtain two degrees. According to Section 4.1.3.2.1, a student shifting within the same college or from one college to another must submit a letter addressed to the College Dean/Campus Administrator where they intend to shift, recommended by the Dean of their current college. Additionally, they must provide a Clearance (good moral standing, no current obligations to the college), approved by the Dean, stating their release from the College in which they were previously enrolled. Furthermore, according to Section 1.7 of the handbook, no cross-enrollee from another institution shall be admitted into the Institute without the written permission from the Registrar's Office of the originating school. Therefore, enrolling in two different colleges at EARIST at the same time would require multiple approvals and permissions, which may not be granted.",medium,adversarial,11.86,0.475,0.4439,5,"[36, 33, 95, 90, 79]"
10,How much is the tuition fee per unit?,NOT ANSWERABLE FROM HANDBOOK,"Based on the provided handbook sections, the Institute charges a fixed amount per unit/hour. However, the exact amount of the tuition fee per unit is not specified in the handbook. It is mentioned that the schedule of tuition fees and other charges will be in such amounts as provided under the schedule of fees, but no specific amount is given. Additionally, the handbook states that the educational expenses of EARIST students are free as per R.A. 10931, but this does not provide information on the tuition fee per unit for non-EARIST students.

Therefore, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact amount of the tuition fee per unit. It is recommended to consult with the relevant offices or departments at the Institute for more accurate and up-to-date information.",easy,unanswerable,10.75,0.6421,0.5295,5,"[60, 59, 57, 61, 84]"
11,My required subject isn't offered this sem. Can I just take it at another school?,"Yes, this is called cross-enrollment. It is allowed if the course is not offered at the Institute and you get a permit from the Registrar, which requires an endorsement from your Dean/Campus Administrator. You can only cross-enroll a maximum of six (6) units.","Based on the provided handbook sections, if your required subject is not offered this semester, you may still be able to transfer to another school and continue your studies there. According to Section 2, transferees with no grades of ""Dropped"", ""Incomplete"", and ""Failed"" may be admitted depending on the availability of slots by the chosen program. However, you should check with the specific school you are interested in transferring to, as their admission requirements and policies may differ from those of your current school. Additionally, you would need to submit an official transcript of records from your previous school for evaluation by the Department Chairperson and the Registrar's Office in order to have your credits transferred. If the old curriculum will be followed by the student, he/she does not need to take the Bridging Program for Lifelong Learners. If the new curriculum will be followed by the student, he/she shall be required to enroll and pass the additional general education subjects identified in the Bridging Program for lifelong Learners presented in Section C. 3.",medium,paraphrased,12.62,0.3976,0.3816,5,"[85, 26, 30, 90, 79]"
12,What's the official process for dropping a subject?,"To drop a course, you must fill out SARRMS Form No. 007. This form needs to be endorsed by your College Dean/Campus Administration and then approved by the Vice President for Academic Affairs.","Based on the provided handbook sections, the official process for dropping a subject involves submitting a form during the adjustment period within the prescribed period of time set by the Institute in the school calendar. The student must obtain approval from both the Dean and the Registrar before dropping any subject, shifting courses, or stopping from schooling. It is important to note that dropping a subject may have academic implications and should be carefully considered before making a decision.",easy,direct,5.12,0.4097,0.3729,5,"[220, 90, 79, 219, 35]"
13,I failed my 'Intro to Programming' major. Can I just substitute it with 'Web Development 1'?,"Generally, no. The rules state that no substitution is allowed for major courses you have failed. An exception can only be made if the College Dean evaluates the new course and determines it is 'substantially similar in scope and coverage' to the one you failed.","Based on the provided handbook sections, it is possible for a student to substitute 'Intro to Programming' major with 'Web Development 1' if the student meets the admission requirements and has a passing grade in all subjects including P.E. and NSTP (MTSLTS/CWTS). However, the decision on the student's application for admission would depend on the table below:

COLLEGE: CAS
PROGRAM: BSAP
For Admission: 60.00% or better
Waitlisted: 50.00% – 59.99%
For Realignment: lower than 50.00%

If the student meets the minimum admission requirements and has a passing grade in all subjects including P.E. and NSTP (MTSLTS/CWTS), they can be admitted to the program. They will then undergo an Enhancement Program where they need to enroll and pass one to two enhancement courses during their first year in the program. The cut-off score in the Program Preparedness Tests, the enhancement courses to be taken by conditionally admitted students, and the equivalent units and contact hours are summarized in the table below:

The decision on the student's application for admission shall be based on the table above. If the student is admitted, they will need to undergo the Enhancement Program and pass the required enhancement courses to complete their degree program.",hard,scenario,29.0,0.3749,0.3596,5,"[30, 85, 26, 36, 29]"
14,How many absences am I allowed before I get dropped from a class?,"If your absences exceed 20 percent of the total scheduled hours for a subject (like lectures or labs) in one semester, you will be automatically dropped from the class.","You are a university student advisor with access to the official student handbook.

What does that mean?,A grade of 2.50 is considered 'Satisfactory' and corresponds to a percentage equivalent of 79-81%.,"According to Section 1 of the handbook, a grade is a mark given to a student to reflect their academic performance. A grade of 2.50 typically indicates that the student has passed the subject, but may not have met all the requirements. However, without additional context or information about the specific grading scale used in your institution, it is difficult to determine what exactly a grade of 2.50 means in terms of your overall academic standing or progress.

If you don't, the grade will automatically become a 5.0 (Failed).","Based on the provided handbook sections, there is no specific policy or procedure mentioned regarding how long a student has to fix an INC (Incomplete) grade before it becomes a 5.0. However, Section 11.1.1 states that any student who obtains final grades of ""5.00"" in three (3) courses, accumulated or otherwise, shall be warned by the Dean/Campus Administrator concerned to improve his/her performance. This suggests that if a student has already accumulated two or more ""5.00"" grades, they may be subject to academic delinquency and potential disciplinary action.

It is important to note that students should refer to their individual academic advisors or the Dean's office for specific guidance and policies regarding their academic standing and how to address an INC grade.

However, Section 1 states that obtaining a failing grade may result in rectification of grades, which could potentially include retaking exams. Rectification of grades is done to correct wrong entries of data, as stated in Section 2. 

Additionally, Section 3 outlines the Enhancement Program for students who are conditionally admitted to certain programs, including those in the College of Architecture and Fine Arts (CAFA), College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), and others. This program requires students to enroll and pass one to two enhancement courses during their first year in the program, based on their cut-off score in the Program Preparedness Tests.

Students on probation cannot fail or drop any subject and must not be involved in any disciplinary cases.","Based on the provided handbook sections, here is my understanding of how your friend can get out of academic probation:

Your friend is on academic probation because they have failed at least one subject in the previous semester. To get out of probation, your friend needs to pass all their subjects in the next semester. According to Section 11.2.3 of the handbook, ""probation shall be lifted once a student has passed all his/her subjects in the following semester.""

If your friend fails 50% or more of the total number of units in which they receive final grades in the next semester, they will be dropped from the rolls of the Institute, as per Section 11.2.5.

It's important to note that if your friend has been placed on probation for two successive semesters, they may be dropped from the rolls of the College in which they are enrolled, but they may be readmitted to another College of the Institute to which they qualify, according to Section 11.2.4.

In summary, to get out of academic probation, your friend needs to pass all their subjects in the next semester and maintain a passing grade in at least 50% of the total number of units. If they fail this requirement, they may be dropped from the rolls of the Institute.",medium,paraphrased,18.19,0.5423,0.4942,5,"[45, 91, 80, 44, 232]"
26,I'm a freshman and I failed 2 subjects in my first sem. Am I getting kicked out?,"No. Freshmen who fail three (3) or more courses in their first semester are placed on probation for the second semester. Since you failed two, you will likely be given a warning by the College Dean and referred to counseling. Your academic load for the next semester might also be reduced.","Based on the provided handbook sections, a freshman who fails two subjects in their first semester may not necessarily be kicked out. However, they would need to meet certain requirements to continue enrollment for the next semester.

According to Section 1 of the handbook, a student must have a passing grade in all subjects, including P.E. and NSTP (MTSLTS/CWTS), enrolled in order to qualify for continuance for the following semester. It does not specify that failure in two subjects would result in immediate dismissal.

Additionally, Section 3 of the handbook states that a student must not have a failing grade or dropped subject in the previous semester in order to qualify for continuance for the next semester. Again, this does not specifically mention that two failures would lead to immediate dismissal.

However, if the student fails to meet these requirements, they may be placed on academic probation, as outlined in Section 11 of the handbook. This means that the student's academic load may be reduced and they may need to meet certain academic standards in order to continue enrollment.

It's important to note that the handbook does not provide enough information to determine whether a student would be immediately dismissed for failing two subjects in their first semester. The specific policies and procedures for handling academic delinquency would depend on the institution and its individual policies.",hard,scenario,17.24,0.4452,0.4331,5,"[85, 139, 66, 136, 44]"

28,"I failed 2 subjects, and I also have an INC. Does the INC count towards the 3-failure rule for dismissal?","No, an 'Incomplete' (INC) grade is not included in the computations for scholastic delinquency.

However, we can infer some general qualifications that may be applicable to the position.

Firstly, Section 1 states that the candidate must be currently enrolled in one of the courses in any of the college. This suggests that being an SA requires being a student in good standing at the university.

Secondly, Section 2 outlines the physical, mental, and emotional fitness requirements for students. While this section does not specifically address SA positions, it implies that candidates should be in good health and able to perform the duties required of an SA.

Lastly, Section 3 mentions tertiary education programs, which may include SA positions. However, this section does not provide specific details on the qualifications required for these positions.

In conclusion, while the handbook does not provide specific requirements for becoming a student assistant, being a currently enrolled student in good standing, physically and mentally fit, and meeting the academic load requirements may be general qualifications that could apply to the position.

However, there is no mention of any specific restrictions against being a recipient of both the Tulong Dunong Program and another government scholarship. Therefore, it is possible for a student to be a recipient of both programs, as long as they comply with the requirements and procedures outlined in the handbook.

To be eligible for the Tulong Dunong Program, a student must meet certain criteria, such as being a Filipino citizen, having a high school diploma or its equivalent, and demonstrating financial need. The program also requires the submission of an application form and supporting documents, which can be found on the CHED website.

In addition to the Tulong Dunong Program, there are several government scholarships available to Filipino students, including the CHED-Student Financial Assistance Programs (StuFAPs) Scholarship Grant and the EARIST Faculty Sponsored Scholarship. To apply for these scholarships, students must submit a Scholarship Form from the Office of Student Affairs and Services, along with the required documents and signatures.

It is important for students to carefully review the requirements and procedures for each scholarship or grant they are applying for, and to ensure that they meet all necessary qualifications before submitting their application. Students should also consult with the Scholarship Coordinator or other relevant university officials if they have any questions or concerns about the application process.",medium,adversarial,19.62,0.6024,0.4185,5,"[95, 67, 86, 75, 93]"

Additionally, students may be allowed to wear organizational shirts if the recognized organization is conducting an activity approved by the Institute (Section 1.1.2).

You should probably assume the more serious classification.","Based on the provided handbook sections, cheating would be considered a minor offense under Section 4.1.2.1. The handbook defines an offense as ""something that is wrong or improper,"" and while cheating may be considered unethical or dishonest, it does not fall under the category of gross misconduct, possession of deadly weapons, or other major offenses listed in Sections 2 and 3.

It's always best to refer to your specific school's handbook for more accurate information.",hard,adversarial,8.43,0.5089,0.479,5,"[111, 108, 138, 229, 107]"

Therefore, bringing or drinking alcohol on campus is not permitted.",easy,direct,4.81,0.5763,0.5214,5,"[105, 146, 148, 106, 109]"
52,Is it okay if I join a student org that isn't officially recognized by the school?,"No, it is not okay. Membership in an unrecognized student organization is listed as a major offense.","According to the student handbook, it is not possible to join a student organization that is not officially recognized by the school. Section 11 of the handbook states that all activities of student organizations must be approved by the Office of Student Affairs and Services (OSAS) and that recognized student organizations are entitled to privileges and benefits such as the use of the Institute's facilities. Additionally, Section 12 outlines rules and guidelines for accredited student organizations, including requirements for collection of membership fees and approval of income-generating projects.

It is also important to note that joining an unrecognized student organization could potentially put you in violation of the school's policies and procedures. For example, Section 7 of the handbook outlines policies on approval of activities, including requirements for all curricular and extra-curricular activities to be approved by the Institute President through VPAA and SAS Director. Joining an unrecognized organization could potentially put you in violation of these policies.

In summary, it is not possible to join a student organization that is not officially recognized by the school, and doing so could potentially put you in violation of the school's policies and procedures.",medium,paraphrased,70.44,0.5872,0.5102,5,"[162, 159, 161, 155, 154]"
53,What is the school's policy on smoking or vaping?,Smoking or vaping in unauthorized areas is a minor offense. The handbook also specifies that the Institute is a strictly no-smoking area.,"According to Section 4.1.2.6 of the student handbook, smoking and vaping are prohibited in unauthorized areas on campus. This means that students are not allowed to smoke or vape anywhere on campus except in designated smoking or vaping areas. It is important for students to comply with this policy to ensure a safe and healthy environment for everyone on campus.",easy,direct,7.27,0.5427,0.4986,5,"[109, 110, 112, 106, 105]"
54,I recorded my professor's Zoom class and posted it on social media. Am I in trouble?,"Yes, that is a major offense. The handbook lists 'Unauthorized posting of class videos, recordings, pictures or statements in social media' as a major offense.","According to Section 4.1.1.35 of the student handbook, recording or reproducing videos, pictures, or statements of virtual classes without the permission of the faculty is considered an act that violates the rights of others. Therefore, if you recorded your professor's Zoom class and posted it on social media without their consent, you could be in trouble.

However, it's important to note that this policy may not cover all situations related to online classes. For example, if your professor explicitly gave you permission to record the class and share it with others, then you may not be in violation of the handbook. Additionally, if the recording contains no personal or sensitive information about your professor or other students, then it's possible that the offense may be considered less severe.

If you're unsure about whether you're in trouble, it's best to speak with your professor or a school administrator to clarify the situation. They can provide guidance on what actions to take next and help you understand the consequences of your actions.",medium,scenario,16.19,0.4924,0.3673,5,"[110, 109, 112, 107, 91]"

The handbook does not specify a specific fine for this offense. However, it does state that ""minor offenses may result in disciplinary action up to and including suspension."" It is important to note that the specific consequences for a particular offense will depend on various factors such as the severity of the offense, the individual's prior record, and whether it is a first-time or repeat offense. Therefore, it would be best to consult with the appropriate university authority to determine the specific consequences for littering.",easy,unanswerable,7.09,0.3397,0.2651,5,"[111, 108, 91, 80, 229]"
56,My org has an 'initiation'. Is that considered 'hazing' and a major offense?,Yes. Hazing is defined as 'inflicting physical or emotional pain and suffering on a neophyte' and is listed as a major offense. This would be banned.,"According to Section 4.1.1.11 of the student handbook, membership in an unrecognized student organization is a major offense. While there is no specific mention of ""initiation"" as a separate offense, it is important to note that any activity or practice that involves physical or emotional harm, degradation, or humiliation to new members could potentially be considered hazing.

Hazing is defined in Section 4.1.1.10 as ""instigating, leading or participating in any concerted activity leading to stoppage of classes or preventing students/faculty members/administrative personnel from attending classes/offices."" This includes any activity or practice that creates a hostile environment or causes physical or psychological harm to individuals, regardless of whether it is officially sanctioned or recognized by the institution.

Therefore, while there is no explicit mention of ""initiation"" as a separate offense, any activity or practice that involves physical or emotional harm, degradation, or humiliation to new members could potentially be considered hazing and a major offense according to the student handbook. It is important for student organizations to adhere to the policies and guidelines outlined in the handbook to avoid any potential disciplinary actions.",medium,adversarial,29.77,0.4536,0.4122,5,"[109, 159, 110, 112, 107]"
57,What's the most severe penalty the school can give a student?,The most severe disciplinary sanction is Expulsion.,"Based on the provided handbook sections, the most severe penalty the school can give a student is expulsion. Expulsion is listed under Section 4.1.2.15 as the third and succeeding loss of ID in the entire stay at EARIST. This means that if a student loses their ID three times or more during their entire stay at the university, they may be expelled. It is important to note that this is just one possible consequence for losing ID, and there may be other penalties depending on the circumstances. Additionally, it is important to review the full Student Handbook for a complete understanding of the consequences for different types of offenses.",easy,direct,10.88,0.6901,0.6106,5,"[109, 107, 110, 112, 91]"
58,What's the difference between being 'dismissed' and 'expelled'?,"Dismissal means you are dropped from the Institute's roll, but you can still transfer to another school. Expulsion is the most extreme penalty; you are dropped from the roll and also disqualified from being admitted to any other public or private educational institution.","Based on the provided handbook sections, there seems to be some confusion regarding the terms ""dismissed"" and ""expelled."" However, I will do my best to provide a clear and helpful answer based on the available information.

According to Section 1 of the handbook, expulsion refers to the act of forcing someone to leave with justifiable cause or reason. This typically involves a formal process that includes charges, evidence, and a hearing before a disciplinary board or committee. The handbook does not provide specific details on what constitutes justifiable cause or reason for expulsion, but it may include academic dishonesty, physical harm to others, or other serious offenses.

On the other hand, Section 2 of the handbook defines dismissal as discharge. While this term may be used interchangeably with expulsion in some contexts, it is important to note that dismissal can refer to any situation where a student is removed from schooling, regardless of the reason. This could include voluntary withdrawal, transfer to another institution, or even failure to meet academic standards.

In summary, while both expulsion and dismissal involve removing someone from schooling, expulsion typically involves a formal process with charges and evidence, while dismissal can refer to any situation where a student is removed from schooling, including voluntary withdrawal or failure to meet academic standards. It is important for students to understand the specific policies and procedures related to expulsion and dismissal at their respective institutions, as these can vary widely depending on the school's policies and procedures.",medium,paraphrased,16.94,0.714,0.5647,5,"[221, 219, 241, 91, 80]"
59,Does EARIST have a guidance counselor I can talk to?,"Yes, the school provides Guidance and Counseling Services. These services use an integrated approach to help students, including counseling, information/orientation, testing, and referrals.","Based on the provided handbook sections, it appears that EARIST does offer counseling services to its students. According to Section 2, counseling is defined as a goal-oriented relationship between a professionally trained, competent counselor and an individual seeking help. Additionally, Section 3 lists student rights, including the right to participate in matters affecting their welfare and to establish development for their future, which could potentially include access to counseling services.

However, the handbook does not provide specific information on whether EARIST has dedicated guidance counselors available for students to talk to. It is possible that counseling services may be provided by faculty members or other qualified individuals within the institution, but further information would be needed to determine the specifics of these services.",easy,direct,10.02,0.3446,0.3153,5,"[26, 114, 96, 25, 23]"

Does the school have programs to help me find a job?,"Yes, the Institute provides Career and Job Placement Services, which include offering regular career seminars and other services to help students with employment.","Based on the provided handbook sections, it appears that the school does not have a specific program to help students find a job upon graduation. However, the handbook does mention several services that may be useful in this regard.

Under Section 4.9, Services for Students with Special Needs and Persons with Disabilities, the Institute accommodates students with disabilities and learners with special needs. This could include providing resources and support to help these students find employment after graduation.

Additionally, the handbook mentions the EARIST Cultural Affairs Division (ECAD) which generates interest and participation in cultural/artistic activities by designing workshops. While this may not directly assist with finding a job, it could potentially lead to networking opportunities and exposure to different industries.

Finally, the Sports and Physical Development Programs mentioned in Section 4.11 could also be beneficial in helping students find employment, as many companies value physical fitness and wellness.

Overall, while the school may not have a specific program to help students find a job upon graduation, there are several services and resources available that could be useful in this regard. It is recommended that the student reach out to the relevant offices or departments for more information and guidance.",easy,paraphrased,15.22,0.298,0.2813,5,"[93, 83, 48, 149, 71]"

Section 4.4.1 states that the medical-dental program observes policy on wellness and healthy lifestyle. Additionally, Section 4.4.2 mentions that the medical-dental program provides adequate facilities for maintaining health care and maintaining updated health records.

In terms of specific services, Section 4.4.2 states that all bonafide students may avail themselves of the following:

1. Routine dental examination
2. Free tooth extraction (only if indicated)

It is important to note that emergency cases may be referred to the hospital of choice, and in such cases, health service must be notified at the soonest possible time (Section 4. Emergency Cases).

However, it is worth mentioning that the handbook does not provide detailed information about the specific services offered by the school clinic beyond these two mentioned services.

## SECTION 7. RETENTION POLICIES


The Institute shall dismiss students who do not show satisfactory performance in their academic undertaking. ### 7.1 Old students, except those in the senior year, with failures corresponding to three (3) or more courses within a semester or five (5) cumulative unauthorized withdrawal (dropped) at the end of any semester or summer term will not be readmitted in the succeeding semesters by reasons of poor academic records. The same rule shall apply to students who did not take the regular load and incurred failures equivalent to one-half of the load carried in the preceding semester. ### 7.2 A student with a failing grade shall be given a warning by the College Dean/Campus Administrator and referred to the Counseling and Testing Office for appropriate guidance. The student's load for the succeeding semester shall be correspondingly reduced, e.g., by one load if he/she failed in one. ### 7.3 Freshman students who in their first semester incur failures corresponding to three (3) or more courses or the equivalent of one-half of their load, shall be allowed to enroll under probation in the second semester but only in courses authorized by their Deans/Campus Administrator. ### 7.4 Students on probation should not fail or drop even one subject nor be involved in any disciplinary case during the semester that immediately follows. ### 7.5 Students can only be on probation twice. Inability to lift the second probation, a student will be ineligible to enroll for the succeeding semester. ### 7.6 Students who fail and/or withdraw (authorized or unauthorized) thrice in the same course (or subject) will be dropped from the roll. ### 7.7 A grade of ""Incomplete"" is not included in the computations of determining scholastic delinquency. When it is replaced by a final grade, the latter is to be included in the grades during the semester when the removal is made. ### 7.8 A student who is due for dismissal but who has been enrolled before the dismissal status shall be permitted to remain up to the end of the semester or intercession in which it occurs. ### 7.9 Pre-requisites courses in which a student has failed shall take precedence over other subjects in his succeeding enrollment. ### 7.10 In colleges or schools in which the weight of the course is not expressed in terms of units, the computation shall be based on the respective equivalents. ### 7.11 Any student who at the end of the semester obtains final Grades of “5.00” in 40%-75% of the total number of academic units in which he receives final grades shall be dropped from the rolls of the College concerned:


- 7.11.1 If more than 75%, he/she shall be dropped from the Institute;
- 7.11.2 Any student who at the end of the semester or term obtains final grades of “5.00” in more than 75% of the total number of academic units in which he receives final grades shall be dropped from the rolls of the College concerned.",easy,unanswerable,69.23,0.3721,0.3525,5,"[39, 141, 40, 203, 48]"
63,I left my laptop in a classroom. Is the school security office responsible for helping me find it?,"No. The handbook states that personal properties like laptops, cellphones, and cash are the 'sole responsibility of the student.' The Security and Safety Office is not held accountable for lost belongings unless you formally deposited those items with them for safekeeping.","Based on the provided handbook sections, the school security office is responsible for assisting students in locating lost personal items such as laptops, cameras, and other personal belongings within the Institute premises. However, this assistance is limited to reporting the item to the EARIST Security and Safety office and the Institute General Police (IGP) for the forms to be filled up for recording purposes. The Security and Safety Office will not be held accountable in case of loss of such belongings unless the same were duly deposited and recorded in their office.

If your laptop was not properly deposited and recorded with the Security and Safety Office before you left it in the classroom, then the office may not be able to assist you in finding it. It is important to note that personal properties such as jewelry, watches, cash, cellphones, cameras, laptops, and others will be the sole responsibility of the student who owned the same.

Therefore, if you have lost your laptop, you should first report it to the EARIST Security and Safety office and provide them with all necessary details such as the location where you last saw it, a description of the item, and any identifying features. The Security and Safety Office will then proceed to search for the item and notify you once they have found it.",medium,scenario,27.28,0.4309,0.374,5,"[146, 112, 110, 109, 145]"
64,What benefits do student-athletes get?,"Student-athletes are eligible for several benefits, including a monthly allowance, travel allowances, free uniforms and personal equipment, and certificates of recognition for winning competitions.","Based on the provided handbook sections, student-athletes at EARIST receive several benefits. These include:

1. Monthly allowance during training and completion.
2. Travel allowances during training and competitions. This includes free travel to local competitions.
3. Free seminars and workshops for respective events.
4. Free uniforms, competition shoes, and other personal equipment.
5. Certificate of Recognition for winners at local, regional, national, and international competitions.
6. Attendance to classes.
7. Establish and maintain athletic and scholastic eligibility.
8. Attend mandatory training sessions as scheduled and approved by the Office Head.
9. Develop good sportsmanship.
10. Develop and foster respect for teammates, coaches, officials, and spectators.

Additionally, student-athletes may be subject to forfeiture from the roster if they violate rules and regulations stated in the EARIST Student Handbook, non-participation to practice, tune-up games, and proper competitions without valid reasons, or culpable violation of rules and regulations from any sports competitions acknowledged by EARIST.

It is important to note that the handbook does not provide specific information on additional benefits beyond those listed above.",easy,direct,16.99,0.6457,0.5486,5,"[151, 152, 153, 150, 131]"
65,"I'm on the varsity team, so my grades don't matter as much, right?",That is incorrect. A requirement to be a student-athlete (for old students) is to have 'No failed grades in his/her previous semester'. One of your duties as an athlete is to 'Establish and maintain athletic and scholastic eligibility'.,"Based on the provided handbook sections, it is not accurate to say that being on the varsity team means that grades do not matter as much. While being a student-athlete may have some benefits such as monthly allowances and entitlements, it does not exempt a student from the academic requirements set forth by the institution.

In fact, Section 2 of the handbook states that a student must be enrolled in any bachelor or associate program (undergraduate program) and must not exceed the age limit as mandated by the SCUAA Governing Rule. Additionally, there are no provisions in the handbook that suggest that grades do not matter for student-athletes.

Furthermore, Section 10 of the handbook outlines the requirements for graduation with honors, which are based on a student's cumulative grade point average. Being on the varsity team does not affect a student's eligibility for graduation with honors.

Therefore, while being a student-athlete may provide additional support and benefits, it does not change the academic requirements and expectations set forth by the institution. It is important for all students, including those on the varsity team, to maintain their academic performance and meet the necessary requirements for graduation.",medium,adversarial,15.48,0.3948,0.376,5,"[225, 151, 43, 88, 77]"

This is because the gym was finished in June 1999 and has a 2.5M appropriation from Speaker Jose C. De Venecia, Jr., which suggests that it is intended for use by all members of the student community. Additionally, Section 5 of the handbook states that the Institute encourages students to use campus facilities for meetings, social, cultural, and recreational activities, and that users should always observe safety. Therefore, it seems likely that the gym would be considered one of these facilities and would be open to all students who wish to use it for working out.

Additionally, Section 4.9.2 states that the Institute provides facilities such as a chapel where students can freely express their religious orientations. The OSAS assists in the accreditation of religious student organizations and its activities inside the Institute.

It is important to note that while EARIST offers these support services, it is not clear from the provided handbook whether there are specific policies, procedures, or requirements for students with disabilities to access these services.

This includes a letter of application, the SAS Application Form, your organization's Constitution and By-Laws, a list of officers and members with their details, a confirmation form from your faculty adviser, and a master plan of your proposed activities for the year.","According to the student handbook, starting a new student organization requires several steps. First, you need to determine whether your organization will be a college-based or institutional organization.

The processing of your accreditation application should be completed within 15 working days after submission.

Once your organization has been recognized/accredited, you can begin operating and collecting membership fees/dues. However, there are certain rules and guidelines that you must follow, as outlined in section 12. These include limitations on membership fees, the requirement for an official receipt for all payments, and the need to report the total number of members to the college dean, college student council, and OSAS.

This requires a recommendation from the ECC Administrator and admission is dependent on available slots and your compliance with all admission requirements.","Based on the provided handbook sections, it is possible for a student currently enrolled in the Cavite campus to transfer to the Manila campus. However, the transfer process depends on the availability of slots and the student meeting all the academic and admission requirements set forth by the Institute.

If the student meets these requirements, they may submit their Official Transcript of Records to be evaluated by the Department Chairperson and the Registrar's Office. The subject(s) taken from the previous school may be credited upon this evaluation.

94,I'm taking my OJT this semester. Can I also enroll in a major subject I failed before?,"This is generally not allowed. Students who still have an academic subject (like a major or minor course) enrolled are not permitted to take their training outside of the school. An exception might be made for specialized programs, but only if your class schedule does not conflict with your training hours. In-house training (within the school) is allowed.","Based on the provided handbook sections, it appears that you can enroll in a major subject that you failed before while completing your On-The-Job Training (OJT). 

According to Section 12.1, each student undergoing OJT should enroll in a practicum or equivalent course. There is no mention of any restrictions on enrolling in additional courses, including major subjects, as long as the student is in good academic standing and has completed all pre-requisite subjects (as per Section 12.1.2). 

Furthermore, there is no mention of any restrictions on enrolling in major subjects for students who are on probation or have failed in 50% or more of the total number of units in which they receive final grades (as per Sections 11.2.3, 11.2.4, and 11.2.5). 

However, it's important to note that if you are a returning student or a shifting student, you may need to comply with additional requirements and procedures, such as submitting necessary documents and obtaining approval from the relevant college deans, as per Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3.

It is also worth noting that students must be enrolled (Sections 1 and 2) and may face disciplinary action if they engage in prohibited behaviors such as defamation, bullying, or improper grooming and/or uniform (Sections 3 and 4).

96,I want to run for ISG President. My GWA is 2.75 and I have no failing grades. Am I eligible?,"No, you are not eligible. A qualification for officers of the ISG (Institute Student Government) is to have a GPA of 2.50 or higher. In the EARIST grading system, a lower number is a better grade, so your 2.75 GWA is not high enough to meet the 2.50 requirement.","Based on the provided handbook sections, you are eligible to run for ISG President. Section 2.3.2.4 states that all qualified officers are entitled to re-election. Additionally, Section 2.3.2.5 states that qualifications for officers of ISG and CSG include being a bonafide student, carrying a minimum load, and not having a failing grade and dropped subject in the previous semester. Your GWA of 2.75 and lack of failing grades meet these requirements. However, it is important to note that there may be other qualifications or disqualifications that are specific to your college or program that you should also consider before running for office.",hard,scenario,9.79,0.5251,0.4617,5,"[134, 73, 27, 135, 65]"
97,"I want to run for student council. My GWA is excellent (2.0), but I did fail one class last year. Can I still run?","No, you cannot. A qualification to be an officer of the ISG or CSG is that you 'must not have a failing grade'.","Based on the information provided in the handbook, it appears that there are several requirements for running for student council. These include having at least one year residency, not having been found guilty of any disqualifying offense, obtaining a GPA of 2.50 or higher, and completing at least 75% of the total number of academic units required for graduation.

However, it is important to note that the handbook does not specifically address the issue of running for student council with a GWA of 2.0 and a failing grade in one class. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer without additional context or clarification from the relevant authorities. It may be best to consult with the appropriate college or university officials to determine if you meet all of the necessary qualifications for running for student council.",medium,adversarial,10.59,0.3969,0.3858,5,"[135, 85, 136, 44, 139]"
98,Can students bring a car to school? Is there a parking lot for students?,NOT ANSWERABLE FROM HANDBOOK,"Based on the provided handbook sections, it is not clear whether students are allowed to bring cars to school. However, Section 4.5.1.2 states that all personal items that will be brought inside the Institute premises must be reported to the EARIST Security and Safety office and IGP for the forms to be filled up for recording purposes. This suggests that bringing a car to school may require additional paperwork and authorization.

Additionally, Section 4.5.1.6 states that students who want to play basketball, volleyball, and do other activities are not allowed to enter the Institute premises during Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays except upon prior authority from the Institute President and/or his/her authorized representative. It is not specified whether this policy applies to driving a car on these days.

Therefore, while the handbook does not provide a direct answer to the question about bringing a car to school, it suggests that students may need to follow certain procedures and obtain necessary authorization before doing so.",easy,unanswerable,19.91,0.4739,0.4399,5,"[106, 146, 105, 39, 109]"

However, the handbook mentions the existence of an International Internship program which involves completing academic work abroad for the purpose of completing an academic degree. Additionally, the handbook also mentions the possibility of studying abroad through a university program, but it does not provide specific details on how to apply or what the requirements are. Therefore, if you are interested in studying abroad, I would recommend reaching out to EARIST's International Relations Office or consulting with their academic advisors for more information on available options and requirements.",easy,direct,12.12,0.5958,0.4706,5,"[174, 23, 65, 82, 27]"

Any group that wishes to use the EARIST Logo on merchandise (like t-shirts) that will be sold must secure approval from the Information and Public Affairs Services (InfoPAS Office).","Based on the provided handbook sections, your organization would need to obtain permission from the Information and Public Affairs Services (InfoPAS Office) before selling t-shirts with the EARIST logo on them. This is because the use of the EARIST logo and trademarks is regulated and requires authorization.

To secure approval, your organization would need to submit a request to the InfoPAS Office, detailing the intended use of the EARIST logo and trademarks on the t-shirts. The request should include information on the products, merchandise, or services that will be sold or distributed to the public.

Once the request is received and reviewed, the InfoPAS Office will determine whether the proposed use complies with the regulations governing the use of the EARIST logo and trademarks. If approved, your organization can proceed with selling the t-shirts featuring the EARIST logo.

It's important to note that the handbook does not provide specific information on the process for obtaining permission or the required documentation. However, it does mention that individuals, groups, or organizations wishing to use the EARIST logo or trademarks must secure a permit from the InfoPAS Office.",medium,scenario,27.31,0.6026,0.4621,5,"[99, 173, 164, 172, 105]"
