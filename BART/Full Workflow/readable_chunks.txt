The evaluation of the interviewer is final and unappealable. ### Screening Level 3: Program Preparedness Test
Program Preparedness Tests are placement examinations specifically designed to assess competency of students on specific skills/disciplines required in the following programs where the student had applied for admission: BS Architecture, BS Applied Physics, BS Mathematics, BS Computer Science, BS Information Technology, BS Psychology, BS Civil Engineering, BS Chemical Engineering, BS Computer Engineering, BS Electronics and Communications Engineering, BS Electrical Engineering, and BS Mechanical Engineering. To increase the chances of students' success in their chosen program, students who scored lower than the pre-determined cut-off score in the Program Preparedness Tests may only be conditionally admitted in the program.

--- Chunk 77 ---
If they will be allowed to enroll, they shall undergo an Enhancement Program where they need to enroll and pass one to two enhancement courses during their first year in the program.

EARIST Hymn


Let the EARIST music fill the air
With the echo our spirit rise
There's a magic that will stir the hearts
When we sing our lively tuneful march
What a joy to sing the music gay
When it sounds with a beat of martial air
Let the call of duty we obey
And the service we give every day. EARIST your name is in our hearts
EARIST our love will always spark
We pledge to stand by you, thru our
Noble thoughts and deeds,
To give you our love and loyalty forever
