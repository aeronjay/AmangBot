However, they may be allowed to enroll more than the maximum allowable load during a regular semester under certain conditions, such as back courses in their curriculum checklist, courses without pre-requisites, and recommended by the Dean/Campus Administrator and approved by the Vice President for Academic Affairs.

For irregular students, the maximum academic units they can enroll in per semester is less than the full load required in their curriculum.

For special students, there is no limit on the number of units they can enroll in per semester, as long as they are not earning formal academic credits.

However, you may be allowed to enroll additional three (3) units under certain conditions, such as back courses in your curriculum checklist and courses without pre-requisites. It is important to note that these additional units must be recommended by the Dean/Campus Administrator and approved by the Vice President for Academic Affairs.

If you are a regular student and have a part-time job, you may want to consider enrolling in the minimum required load of 6 units during the intersession class. This would allow you to balance your academic responsibilities with your part-time job. If you feel that you need more units to maintain your desired academic progress, you could discuss this with your academic advisor to see if they can recommend additional courses that meet the criteria mentioned above.",medium,scenario,14.16,0.6491,0.6133,5,"['handbook_chunk_019', 'handbook_chunk_037', 'handbook_chunk_018', 'handbook_chunk_020', 'handbook_chunk_035']"

11,My required subject isn't offered this sem. Can I just take it at another school?,"Yes, this is called cross-enrollment. It is allowed if the course is not offered at the Institute and you get a permit from the Registrar, which requires an endorsement from your Dean/Campus Administrator. You can only cross-enroll a maximum of six (6) units.","According to the Handbook Sections provided, cross-enrolling in another school is allowed under certain conditions. However, before proceeding with cross-enrollment, you should first check if the required subject is being offered in the next semester or if it can be taken online. If neither option is available, then cross-enrollment may be considered.

To cross-enroll, you will need to submit a request to the Registrar's Office and obtain written permission from the Dean/Campus Administrator of the school where you wish to take the subject. Additionally, you will need to provide a copy of your Official Transcript of Records and have it evaluated by the Department Chairperson and the Registrar's Office.

It's important to note that cross-enrollment is only allowed up to a maximum of six (6) units per semester.

13,I failed my 'Intro to Programming' major. Can I just substitute it with 'Web Development 1'?,"Generally, no. The rules state that no substitution is allowed for major courses you have failed. An exception can only be made if the College Dean evaluates the new course and determines it is 'substantially similar in scope and coverage' to the one you failed.","According to the information provided in Section 3.3 of the Handbook, substitution of courses is allowed in certain cases such as when a required course is not offered or when a curriculum has been superseded by a new one. However, the proposed substitute course must be aligned with the one being substituted, have the same or higher number of units, involve courses within the same department if possible, and be recommended by the Program Chairperson, endorsed by College Dean and Registrar, and approved by the Vice President for Academic Affairs.

In this case, since you failed your 'Intro to Programming' major, it is unlikely that 'Web Development 1' would be considered a suitable substitute course as they are not substantially similar in scope and coverage. It is recommended that you speak with your college dean or academic advisor to discuss your options for replacing your failed course.

If you arrive within those first 10 minutes, you are considered 'tardy'.","Based on the provided information, a student is considered late or tardy if they arrive in class during the first 1/6 fraction of the scheduled class time. This means that if a class is scheduled for three hours, a student would be considered tardy if they arrive more than 30 minutes late. If a class is scheduled for two hours, a student would be considered tardy if they arrive more than 20 minutes late.

Does that equal one absence?,"Yes, the rules state that three incidences of tardiness shall be considered as one absence from class.","According to Section 5.3 of the Handbook, a student is considered absent from class if they arrive after the first 1/6 fraction of the scheduled class time. Therefore, three instances of tardiness would not necessarily equal one absence.

1. Submit a medical certificate: You need to provide a medical certificate from the Institute's Medical Officer or any other physician, verifying your illness. This certificate should be submitted to the College Dean as soon as possible.
2. Notify the faculty member: Inform your faculty member about your illness and the reason for your absence. They will then report your excused absence to the College Dean.
3. Comply with other class requirements: Even though you have been granted an excused absence, you still need to complete any outstanding assignments or participate in class discussions within a reasonable period of time.
4. Avoid further absences: Make sure to attend all remaining classes and avoid any further absences, as three consecutive unexcused absences could lead to disciplinary action.
