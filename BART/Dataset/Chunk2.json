    "content": "The Eulogio \"Amang\" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST) was established following the liberation of Manila in 1945, originally named the Eulogio Rodriguez Vocational High School (ERVHS). On July 1, 1946, the institute acquired its present site in Nagtahan, Sampaloc, Manila. The institution's evolution is defined by three major legislative acts. Republic Act No. 4072 (1964) authorized the Technical Education Department. Republic Act No. 5088 (1967) renamed the school to Eulogio \"Amang\" Rodriguez Memorial School of Arts and Trades (EARMSAT). Republic Act No. 6595 (1972) converted EARMSAT into EARIST, making it a full-fledged college. Presidential Decree No. 1524 (1978) further converted EARIST into a Chartered State College with a Board of Trustees. The current President is Dr. Editha V. Pillo as of 2021. EARIST is currently rated as a Level II State University College (SUC) and a Level II Comprehensive Teaching and Baccalaureate University.",

This resolution approved the opening of GASAT as an EARIST branch in General Mariano Alvarez, Cavite, with funding from the EARIST budgetary allotment. In 1983, the National Housing Authority donated a 31,282 square meter lot for the school site. The groundbreaking for the main building occurred on March 2, 1990, led by Dr. Lydia Macaraig Profeta. Construction was funded largely through congressional insertions from Congressman Renato P. Dragon, totaling over PHP 42 million for phases I-X between 1989 and 1999. Additionally, a Multi-Purpose Sports Complex Gymnasium was completed in 1999 with appropriations from Speaker Jose C. De Venecia, Jr.",

    "content": "Under Article XIV Right to Proper Information, the Institute regulates the use of official social media accounts. EARIST uses social media to supplement marketing efforts and encourages students to share Institute news. However, students must understand that by mentioning EARIST or sharing its information, they automatically serve as representatives of the Institute. The Institute reserves the right to request the removal of content if it poses a risk to the reputation of the Institute, its employees, or students.\n\nPermission to post digital materials on official accounts is subject to specific guidelines. The press is considered a public trust and must not be used for unlawful or divisive purposes. While the Institute recognizes the student press as a medium of learning under the Campus Journalism Act of 1991, all digital announcements must bear the signature of the SAS Director and be endorsed to the Information and Public Affairs Services (InfoPAS) Director for posting. Furthermore, digital materials must not violate contemporary ethical or moral standards regarding messages or imagery.",
