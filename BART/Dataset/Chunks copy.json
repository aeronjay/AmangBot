    "content": "HISTORY OF EARIST\n\nThe Eulogio \"Amang\" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST) was established after the liberation of Manila in 1945. EARIST traces back its development from Vocational High School with only a room at the second floor of the Mapa High School, nine teachers, a clerk, and 147 students under Mr. Pantaleon Regala, its principal. Its former name was Eulogio Rodriguez Vocational High School (ERVHS).\n\nOn July 1, 1946, EARIST acquired its present site at Nagtahan, Sampaloc, Manila. Mr. Apolinario Apilado was appointed as principal. He was succeeded by Dr. Hilario G. Nudas in 1949.\n\nEARIST's growth and development were made possible via three Republic Acts and Presidential Decree, to wit:\n\n- **Republic Act No. 4072**, jointly sponsored by Congressman Ramon D. Bagatsing and Salih Ujutalam in 1964, authorized the establishment of the Technical Education Department without changing the name of the school. It was headed by a Vocational Director.\n- **Republic Act No. 5088**, sponsored by the late Congressman Sergio Loyola in 1967, authorized the renaming of ERVHS to Eulogio \"Amang\" Rodriguez Memorial School of Arts and Trades (EARMSAT) and signaled its separation from the Division of City Schools, Manila. It was headed by a Superintendent.\n- **Republic Act No. 6595**, sponsored by Congressman Joaquin R. Roces in 1972, converted EARMSAT to Eulogio \"Amang\" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST) with a President as its head. This made EARIST into a full-fledged College and authorized the establishment of Vocational-Technical School branches in each Congressional District of Manila.\n- **Presidential Decree No. 1524**, signed by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on June 11, 1978, converted EARIST into a Chartered State College with Board of Trustees as its Governing Body and Dr. Hilario G. Nudas, as its first College President. In 1983, Dr. Frederick So Pada as SUC President followed by Dr. Lydia M. Profeta. Dr. Arturo P. Casuga is the 4th president followed by the 6th President Dr. Eduardo S. Caillao in 2006 to 2010. The 7th and current President of EARIST is Dr. Editha V. Pillo.\n\nToday, EARIST is:\n- Baccalaureate College\n- Comprehensive Teaching and Baccalaureate University LEVEL II\n- Graduate Capable HEIs LEVEL III (Results of the CARNEGIE 2003 Classification Evaluation on the Typology of Philippine Higher Institution)\n- Awarded LEVEL II STATUS in the Fourteen (14) Degrees Program (Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines)\n- Rated SUC LEVEL II (CHED-DBM-PASUC Leveling Evaluation)",
