HISTORY OF EARIST


The Eulogio "Amang" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST) was established after the liberation of Manila in 1945. EARIST traces back its development from Vocational High School with only a room at the second floor of the Mapa High School, nine teachers, a clerk, and 147 students under Mr. Pantaleon Regala, its principal. Its former name was Eulogio Rodriguez Vocational High School (ERVHS).


On July 1, 1946, EARIST acquired its present site at Nagtahan, Sampaloc, Manila. Mr. Apolinario Apilado was appointed as principal. He was succeeded by Dr. Hilario G. Nudas in 1949.


EARIST's growth and development were made possible via three Republic Acts and Presidential Decree, to wit:


- **Republic Act No. 4072**, jointly sponsored by Congressman Ramon D. Bagatsing and Salih Ujutalam in 1964, authorized the establishment of the Technical Education Department without changing the name of the school. It was headed by a Vocational Director.
- **Republic Act No. 5088**, sponsored by the late Congressman Sergio Loyola in 1967, authorized the renaming of ERVHS to Eulogio "Amang" Rodriguez Memorial School of Arts and Trades (EARMSAT) and signaled its separation from the Division of City Schools, Manila. It was headed by a Superintendent.
- **Republic Act No. 6595**, sponsored by Congressman Joaquin R. Roces in 1972, converted EARMSAT to Eulogio "Amang" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST) with a President as its head. This made EARIST into a full-fledged College and authorized the establishment of Vocational-Technical School branches in each Congressional District of Manila.
- **Presidential Decree No. 1524**, signed by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on June 11, 1978, converted EARIST into a Chartered State College with Board of Trustees as its Governing Body and Dr. Hilario G. Nudas, as its first College President. In 1983, Dr. Frederick So Pada as SUC President followed by Dr. Lydia M. Profeta. Dr. Arturo P. Casuga is the 4th president followed by the 6th President Dr. Eduardo S. Caillao in 2006 to 2010. The 7th and current President of EARIST is Dr. Editha V. Pillo.


Today, EARIST is:
- Baccalaureate College
- Comprehensive Teaching and Baccalaureate University LEVEL II
- Graduate Capable HEIs LEVEL III (Results of the CARNEGIE 2003 Classification Evaluation on the Typology of Philippine Higher Institution)
- Awarded LEVEL II STATUS in the Fourteen (14) Degrees Program (Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines)
- Rated SUC LEVEL II (CHED-DBM-PASUC Leveling Evaluation)

EARISTCAT Rating = (Total Score x 50/No. Of Items) +50


EARISTCAT applications shall be processed at the office of the Student Admission, Registration and Records Management Services (SARRMS) while EARIST College Admission Test shall be administered by the Guidance and Counselling Office of the Student Affairs Services (SAS) in coordination with Management Information System and Technology Services (MISTS).


Screening Level 2: College Admission Interview
The College Admission Interview is intended to help the institution assess the student as a candidate. The interviewer, who is the chairperson or a faculty of the program that the student is applying for, speaks with the student, takes notes, and evaluates the student's leadership potential, determination and perseverance, career choice, and communication skills.


For Architecture and Fine Arts applicants, a Drawing Ability Test (DAT) will be conducted as part of the screening process.


Each college has the prerogative to define their own mechanism and/or evaluation rubric in the assessment of the student's performance in the interview.


The evaluation of the interviewer is final and unappealable.


### Screening Level 3: Program Preparedness Test
Program Preparedness Tests are placement examinations specifically designed to assess competency of students on specific skills/disciplines required in the following programs where the student had applied for admission: BS Architecture, BS Applied Physics, BS Mathematics, BS Computer Science, BS Information Technology, BS Psychology, BS Civil Engineering, BS Chemical Engineering, BS Computer Engineering, BS Electronics and Communications Engineering, BS Electrical Engineering, and BS Mechanical Engineering.

With the echo our spirit rise
There's a magic that will stir the hearts
When we sing our lively tuneful march
What a joy to sing the music gay
When it sounds with a beat of martial air
Let the call of duty we obey
And the service we give every day.
