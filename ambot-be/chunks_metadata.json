Classified as a Government to Citizen (G2C) transaction, this service facilitates the entry of external clients into the academic system. To begin, students must secure several requirements: the 'Approved and accomplished applications for admission' from the College Dean; 'Form 138' or 'Transcript of Records/Certification of Grades' from their previous school; and a 'Certificate of Good Moral Character' with a school dry seal. Transferees must also provide 'Transfer Credentials or Honorable Dismissal'. Freshmen who graduated in a different year than their application may need a certification that their F-137 was not forwarded to other SUCs. Other vital documents include a PSA-authenticated Birth Certificate, a Marriage Certificate for married females (from the PSA), and a 'Voluntary Opt-Out Form' from SRRMS for those choosing to pay tuition. The process starts with a qualifying exam (1 hour 30 mins) and a college interview conducted by the College Dean or Enrollment Officer. Accepted students then undergo medical processing at the Medical and Dental Services (1 hour, fee of 550.00). Next, students submit original credentials to the SRRMS Frontliners for a 5-minute verification; if incomplete, a promissory note is signed. Students may purchase an enrollment envelope at the IGP (25.00). The College Enrollment Officers then assist in subject enlisting, student number assignment, and scholarship tagging (10 minutes). Finally, the enrollment is validated; those opting out pay at the Cashier, and the Certificate of Registration (COR) is reflected on the student portal. The total estimated time is 3 hours and 15 minutes, excluding external factors like queues or connectivity.",

Representative requests need an 'Authorization Letter' and ID photocopies. Transferees must ensure their 'Transcript of Records (Copy for EARIST)' and 'F137' from their previous school are on file. The student first presents their ID to the SRRMS Frontliner, who issues a request slip and assesses fees (5 minutes). Fees are 100.00 per page, plus 25.00 for a security envelope; however, first-time job seekers among new graduates get the first copy for free. Payment is made at the Cashier (3 minutes). The student then submits the form and receipt to SRRMS, where Frontliners schedule the release and Evaluators process the TOR (5 working days). Finally, the student or representative claims the TOR (30 minutes). Total time: 5 working days and 38 minutes.",

    "content": "Under the Library Services organizational structure defined in the EARIST Student Handbook, the administration and operation of the library are governed by specific committees and functional groups. The Library Board Committee is headed by a Chairman appointed by the President of the institution. The Director of the Library serves as the secretary of the committee and disseminates information on the activities done by the committee. The members of the committee are composed of the Deans of different colleges, the Director of Instruction, and a student representative from the student government.\n\nThe Library Committee serves as the Technical Working Group (TWG) in charge of the review and revision of the Library Manual. It performs monitoring and coordinating tasks to ensure smooth operation and efficient delivery of service by the Institute Library. These functions include reviewing the status of library holdings for the purpose of selecting materials, disseminating information pertaining to policies and operations of the library, participating in the Annual Library Budget Preparation, keeping abreast with recent innovations and developments in instruction, and initiating resource-sharing activities or projects to meet the needs of the library.\n\nIn addition to the committee, the Handbook outlines the distinct functions of Professional Librarians and Paraprofessional Librarians. Professional Librarians are responsible for selection and acquisition for collection development, cataloging and classification, provision of bibliographic tools and indexes, and updating current awareness services. They handle information dissemination activities for notices, announcements, and latest news through bulletin boards, signage, newsletters, and media boards. Furthermore, Professional Librarians handle accreditation requirements by preparing needed documents for each program under evaluation, and they manage clearance requirements by signing clearances for student records, enrollment, faculty leaves, transfers, resignations, or retirements. They also facilitate referrals and accommodate endorsements both coming in and going out of the libraries.\n\nParaprofessional Librarians, acting as support staff, manage circulation works to facilitate use and access to the collection. They provide reading guidance to assist users with proper materials and locations. Their preservation activities include repairing and mending materials for longer use. They handle the mechanical and technical preparation of library materials, including accessioning, labeling, catalog cards, and book card production. Paraprofessional staff also prepare documents for physical inventory, maintain the strictest implementation of rules and regulations for discipline and order, and assist with accreditation and clearance requirements similar to professional staff.",

The Director of Library Services maintains an adequate collection that supports the objectives and programs of the school, submits annual program budget proposals and annual reports, supervises library personnel in proper record maintenance and management, evaluates staff job performance, and leads the staff in inventory, cataloging, and classifying books. The Director takes full responsibility for determining policies and procedures in the selection of books in coordination with the library committee and participates in professional organizations.\n\nThe Chief of Operations or Assistant Chief of Library Services oversees the technical, operational, and administrative activities of the library. This role involves implementing policies on library use, acquiring reading materials for students and faculty, organizing materials for maximum use, attending seminars for professional growth, conducting book inventory at the end of the school year, developing good reading habits among students, and working cooperatively with academic and administrative staff.\n\nThe College Librarian is responsible for selecting, developing, cataloging, and classifying library resources. They answer library users’ queries, ensure services meet the needs of specific user groups, assist readers with computer equipment and literature searches, promote library resources, maintain proper decorum inside the library, and perform other duties assigned by the library head.\n\nSupport Staff members are responsible for the overall operations of service desks depending on their assignments. They maintain statistical records such as client usage frequencies, update information files, perform annual physical inventories, encode library documents, shelf-read books, and maintain the preservation and upkeep of library materials.\n\nStudent Assistants and OJT Trainees are tasked with updating shelf-list cards and bibliographic records, repairing slightly mutilated materials, maintaining cleanliness and orderliness, assisting inquiries, helping users with access tools, retrieving books, and maintaining the book collection in all sections.\n\nFinally, Library Coordinators are faculty or personnel designated via Special Order (S.O.) to serve as coordinators for each program.

    "content": "Under the Library Services guidelines regarding the Library Collection, materials are categorized into specific types and organized using standardized systems. The collection includes General Reference Books (encyclopedias, dictionaries, almanacs, atlases, handbooks) which are for room use only. Circulation Books cover broad subjects such as Philosophy, Religion, Social Sciences, Language, Arts, Pure Science, Applied Science, Literature, History, and Geography. Periodicals consist of local and foreign journals, magazines, newspapers, government publications, and vertical files like pamphlets; these are strictly for room use. Electronic Resources include e-books, e-journals, online databases, and digital formats like PDF or HTML accessible via hardware or the internet.\n\nThe library organizes its holdings according to the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) System, which divides knowledge into ten major classes: 000 (General works/Computer Science), 100 (Philosophy/Psychology), 200 (Religion), 300 (Social Sciences), 400 (Language), 500 (Pure Science), 600 (Technology), 700 (Arts & Recreation), 800 (Literature), and 900 (History & Geography). Under this system, books with the same call number are classified as the same subject.\n\nThe library operates on an open-shelf system where materials are arranged by section. Books are labeled with place marks or location symbols on top of the call number to indicate their section. For example, the General Circulation collection uses the 'C' symbol. Undergraduate and graduate theses are labeled by their respective courses. To assist users in locating materials, the Union Card Catalog serves as an alphabetical index. It utilizes an Author Card, Title Card, and Subject Card for each book, interfiled following a word-by-word alphabetical arrangement.",

The Periodical Section is joined with the Graduate School Section on this floor. It provides current and past newspapers, journals, and magazines. The Graduate School Section caters to graduate students and faculty immersed in research, housing theses and dissertations which are strictly for room use and cannot be reproduced. \n\nThe Fourth Floor contains the EARIST Learning Commons (formerly the ICT Room). This section provides access to internet browsing for research work and offers an environment for open communication and collaboration. \n\nAdditionally, the library defines specific 'Readers Services' roles for these sections: The Reference Section assists researchers in book choice; the Filipiniana Section handles local history and culture materials; and the Circulation Section manages the charging and discharging of books.",

The primary objective is to assist clientele in academic development by providing updated resources that support instruction, research, and extension programs. Selection is a collaborative responsibility involving Deans, faculty, library staff, and students. Faculty recommendations form the basis for acquisitions, while library staff ensure a balanced collection by covering areas not included in recommendations.\n\nAcquisition guidelines prioritize knowledge of the book trade, wide selection, and proper recording. Limitations on acquisition include prioritizing current publications of scholarly value over older materials. Duplicate copies are purchased only upon justification of heavy and continuous use. Variant editions are acquired only if they are standard editions or contain substantial changes needed for research. Hardbound books are preferred over paperbacks for durability, with paperbacks purchased only if no other edition exists or demand is high.\n\nThe library maintains specific policies for different material types. For Serials, the library acquires holdings in major fields, public affairs, and research values within financial capabilities. For Filipiniana, the library acquires materials published in or about the Philippines, including government agency publications and university research. The library also engages in Exchanges with other institutions to augment resources.\n\nThe policy for Examination Copies dictates that book dealers send materials for inspection. These are reviewed by Deans, Department Chairs, and Library Committee Representatives, who are given one to two weeks to recommend books for purchase.",

A catalog main entry is created for every document, containing class numbers and subject headings.

Tools used in this process include the Sears List of Subject Headings, DDC, Cutter’s Table, and AACR2.\n\nThe procedure for cataloging books involves classifying the book, identifying the entry point, providing a process slip, encoding the slip for student use, and providing access codes. The purpose of these records is to allow clientele to find information via author, title, subject, series, or illustrator. \n\nTo modernize access, the library employs an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC). This system is supported by Koha, an open-source, web-based integrated library system used for circulation, cataloging, acquisition, serials, patron management, and reporting.

    "content": "The EARIST Library enforces specific procedures for the maintenance and weeding of its collection to ensure materials remain relevant and in good condition. \n\nFor physical maintenance, the degree of damage determines whether a book is mended, rebound, or replaced. Simple mending is applied to torn pages, while re-binding is considered for worn books with important, unobtainable content. If binding or mending is not feasible, the library adopts weeding procedures for textbooks without permanent value, books beyond repair, and out-of-date reference books.\n\nWeeding is defined as the process of removing unneeded materials to keep the collection fresh and responsive. While factors such as the 'sanctity' of the collection or professional work pressure may discourage weeding, the library mandates it due to space limitations and storage costs. \n\nThe criteria for weeding are based on four main factors: \n1. **Last Date of Circulation:** Items not used in ten years (or less depending on type) are candidates for weeding. \n2. **Physical Condition:** Items in bad condition are weeded unless a decision is made to repair or replace them. \n3. **Timeliness:** This includes out-of-date materials (especially in science and technology, where the rule of thumb is 3-5 years), obsolete textbooks, and materials that no longer support the curriculum. \n4. **Reliability and Language:** Materials reflecting outdated viewpoints or in foreign languages that are no longer taught or used by the community are discarded. Translations should be checked periodically.",

It originally occupied a room on the third floor of the Apilado Building under the supervision of Ms. Corazon P. Villafania. In 1986, the library transferred to a larger space on the second floor of the Regala Building to accommodate the growing student population, serving as the central library supervised by Chief Librarian Dr. Flocerfida M. Doña and Ms. Erlinda P. Natal. In 2002, per the directive of President Dr. Maura V. Bautista, the central library was devolved to different colleges to align with the vertical structure policy.\n\nFollowing AACCUP recommendations and accreditation visits, a four-story building was constructed in 2006. The ground floor houses the EARIST Museum. From 2015 to the present, the second floor functions as the General Circulation and Filipiniana Section Library, while the third floor accommodates the Graduate School, Periodicals Section, and Theses Section. The fourth floor serves as the Information Technology Center (ITC), Audio Visual or Multimedia Center, and Learning Commons. The institute remains committed to developing the library to meet modern standards.\n\nThe Library Vision envisions the facility as a resource center of quality information serving stakeholders in the pursuit of academic excellence. The Library Mission is to provide services and materials that are accessible, significant, and appropriate for library users. The stated Objectives of the library are to support the institute's program in instructional research and information needs, provide adequate information resources and facilities to the EARIST academic community to achieve school goals, and to develop, enrich, and maintain the library collection to meet the needs of the school's curriculum and programs.",

    "content": "The EARIST Library enforces strict General Rules and Regulations to maintain order and security. Authorized Users include enrolled EARIST students, faculty members, administrators, and staff. Incoming users, visitors, or alumni are also authorized provided they present a referral letter from their respective library and a valid ID.\n\nUnder the General Rules, a student must possess a validated school ID to enter. To borrow materials, a student must possess an original Certificate of Registration (COR) valid for the current year. The COR is non-transferable; any misrepresentation or passing of the COR to another student makes the owner liable, and borrowing must be done personally. Bags must be surrendered at the baggage counter, though valuable items like cellphones and wallets should be exempted and kept with the owner.\n\nBehavioral protocols dictate that silence must be observed; idle conversations, loud laughter, and unnecessary noise are prohibited. Students are not allowed to eat, sleep, litter, or loiter inside the library. Library facilities must be kept in order, and chairs must be pushed back before leaving. Charging of laptops, cell phones, and other gadgets is strictly prohibited inside the library.\n\nRegarding the handling of materials, leaning or writing on books is prohibited. Students must refrain from hiding or stealing books. Tearing out pages or forging signatures will result in disciplinary actions. Misbehavior risks the suspension of library privileges or suspension from the library at the librarian's discretion, with repeated cases reported to the discipline officer.\n\nAccess for Graduate and undergraduate students and researchers from other schools is limited to room-use only on Fridays, with a maximum of three students per school, upon presentation of a valid ID and referral letter. EARIST Alumni may use the library upon presentation of a valid Alumni ID.",

    "content": "The EARIST Library Circulation Policy defines the procedures for borrowing, loan limits, and penalties for infractions. To borrow books, a student must present a valid Certificate of Registration (COR). Students may refer to the card catalog or OPAC for titles or request librarian assistance.\n\nLoan privileges vary by user type. Students are allowed to borrow a maximum of two (2) books for overnight use only. Books for overnight or weekend use may be borrowed one hour before closing time and must be returned on or before 10:00 AM the following service day. Staff and full-time faculty may borrow a maximum of five (5) books every semester, while part-time faculty may borrow a maximum of three (3) books every semester, provided they present valid identification cards. Faculty loans may extend until the end of the semester.\n\nThe Loan Period varies by material type. Filipiniana books and general collection books are for overnight use only (Monday to Friday). Fiction books can be borrowed for one week. General references, newspapers, magazines, journals, clippings, theses, and dissertations are strictly for room use only. Reproduction of theses and dissertations in whole or in part is prohibited.\n\nRegarding Penalties, failure to return borrowed books results in the confiscation of the valid COR for a period of 3 days to 1 week (excluding weekends and class suspensions due to inclement weather). The librarian reserves the discretion to suspend library privileges for habitual offenders. For Lost and Damaged Materials, a lost book must be reported immediately to avoid sanctions. Lost books must be replaced with the latest edition of the same title; if unavailable, a related title of the latest edition is acceptable.",

The MIS office is physically located on the 4th Floor of the CCS (College of Computer Studies) Building. Students are instructed to approach the MIS Staff on duty, who are authorized to verify student identity and manually reset passwords or address specific queries regarding the portal. A critical requirement for this process is identity verification; students are strictly required to bring and present their valid Student ID and their current Registration Form (COR) before the staff can process any request.\n\nFurthermore, the advisory provides a comprehensive overview of the Management Information Services (MIS) to clarify why students are directed to this specific office. In the context of EARIST, the MIS is defined as the technical unit responsible for managing the institution's data, software systems, and digital infrastructure. It functions as the central hub where critical student data—including grades, class schedules, and personal information—intersects with the technology used to access it, specifically the Student Portal. Consequently, the MIS serves as the primary authority for resolving access issues related to these digital assets.",

Panta**, who is credited with helping spark the idea.\n\n**The Roster (Team Lore):**\nThe development team consists of distinct personalities known for specific traits within the group:\n* **Aeron Jay Bulatao (Leader & Programmer):** Recognized as the 'GOD' and 'Cobra' of the group.\n* **John Luis Labasan (AKA Exit):** The 'Sundalo' who resides in the CAMP AGUINALDO. He is the designated host, as the owner of the house where the team constantly hangs out (tambayan).\n* **Christian Jay Baltazar:** Revered as the 'EABAB GODS,' the 'Hustler,' and simply known as 'Master.'\n* **John Lester B. Navarro:** Known by the alias 'BADING' and the title 'Pinaka Kupal', though he balances this by being a devoted church-goer.\n* **Kenneth Orven T. Asuncion:** The 'ML Gods' (Mobile Legends) Pro Player and the designated 'LRT Buddy.'\n\n**Group History:**\nA key piece of history involves Kenneth Orven Asuncion's entry into the group. He was not originally a member but sought a transfer due to a conflict with a former groupmate named Trixia. The transfer was successfully negotiated by buying **Mr. Al** a milk tea.\n\n**Contact & Supervision:**\nThe project was supervised by Thesis Adviser **Mr. Jovel Advincula** (MIS Office, 4th Floor CCS Building).

    "content": "According to the EARIST Student Handbook 2021, the Eulogio \"Amang\" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST) was established following the liberation of Manila in 1945. It began as a Vocational High School located on the second floor of Mapa High School with nine teachers, 147 students, and Mr. Pantaleon Regala as principal. The institution was originally named Eulogio Rodriguez Vocational High School (ERVHS). On July 1, 1946, the school acquired its present site in Nagtahan, Sampaloc, Manila. \n\nThe institute's evolution is defined by specific legislative acts. Republic Act No. 4072 (1964) authorized the establishment of a Technical Education Department. Republic Act No. 5088 (1967) renamed the institution to Eulogio \"Amang\" Rodriguez Memorial School of Arts and Trades (EARMSAT) and separated it from the Division of City Schools, Manila. Republic Act No. 6595 (1972) converted EARMSAT into EARIST, granting it full-fledged college status and authorizing vocational-technical branches in Manila's congressional districts. Finally, Presidential Decree No. 1524, signed on June 11, 1978, converted EARIST into a Chartered State College governed by a Board of Trustees. Dr. Hilario G. Nudas served as the first College President. Subsequent presidents included Dr. Frederick So Pada, Dr. Lydia M. Profeta, Dr. Arturo P. Casuga, Dr. Maura V. Bautista, and Dr. Eduardo S. Caillo. As of the 2021 Handbook, the 7th President is Dr. Editha V. Pillo.\n\nThe Handbook also details the history of the EARIST Cavite Campus (General Mariano Alvarez, Cavite). Established as EARIST-GASAT via Board Resolution No. 007-82 on March 24, 1982, it was funded through EARIST's budgetary allotment. Significant developments include the acquisition of a 31,282 square meter lot donated by the National Housing Authority in 1983 and the groundbreaking of the main building in 1990 under Dr. Lydia Macaraig Profeta. Infrastructure projects from 1989 to 1999 were funded by congressional insertions from Congressman Renato P. Dragon. The campus includes a Multi-Purpose Sports Complex Gymnasium completed in 1999.",

Applications are processed by the Office of Student Admission, Registration and Records Management Services (SARRMS). The test is administered by the Guidance and Counselling Office of the Student Affairs Services (SAS) in coordination with Management Information System and Technology Services (MISTS). The transmutation formula for EARISTCAT scores is: EARISTCAT Rating = (Total Score x 50 / No. Of Items) + 50.\n\nScreening Level 2 is the College Admission Interview. This interview helps the institution assess the candidate's leadership potential, determination, perseverance, career choice, and communication skills. The interviewer is the chairperson or a faculty member of the program applied for. For Architecture and Fine Arts applicants, a Drawing Ability Test (DAT) is conducted as part of this level. Each college defines its own evaluation rubric, and the interviewer's evaluation is final and unappealable.\n\nScreening Level 3 is the Program Preparedness Test (PPT). These are placement examinations designed to assess competency in specific skills or disciplines. The PPT is required for the following programs: BS Architecture, BS Applied Physics, BS Mathematics, BS Computer Science, BS Information Technology, BS Psychology, BS Civil Engineering, BS Chemical Engineering, BS Computer Engineering, BS Electronics and Communications Engineering, BS Electrical Engineering, and BS Mechanical Engineering.\n\nStudents who score lower than the pre-determined cut-off in the PPT may be conditionally admitted. These conditionally admitted students must undergo an Enhancement Program, requiring them to enroll in and pass one to two enhancement courses during their first year. The Handbook specifies that applicants who do not meet the score requirements for their first-choice program will be advised to apply for their second choice.",

Carrying less than a full load is only permitted if the student has academic deficiencies, is graduating, or if required courses are unavailable. Overloading is generally prohibited but may be allowed up to a maximum of 6 units during a regular semester if the subjects are back courses or have no pre-requisites, subject to approval by the Dean and VP for Academic Affairs. For intersession classes, the regular load is 6 units, with a permissible addition of 3 units for back courses. The Institute does not accept applications for a second baccalaureate degree.\n\n**Changing, Dropping, and Substituting Courses**\nStudents may apply to change classes (subject or schedule) using the College Advisement Slip in cases of schedule conflict, dissolved subjects, or enrollment errors. Substitution of courses is authorized if the old curriculum is superseded or if a required course is not offered. Substituted courses must be aligned in content and have the same or higher number of units. Substitution is not allowed for major courses the student has failed, nor for mandated courses. Dropping a course requires filling out SARRMS Form No. 007.

    "content": "Under Article II Academic Policies, the EARIST Student Handbook 2021 classifies students by admission status, academic load, and year level, while establishing strict attendance protocols.\n\n**Classification of Students**\n* **By Admission Status:** Includes Beginning Freshmen (admitted via EARIST-CAT), Returning Students (Returnees), Shifting Students (Shifters), and Transferring Students (Transferees). Shifters within the same college must submit a letter of justification. Shifters moving to a different college must submit a recommended letter and a Clearance of good moral standing. Transferees from EARIST Cavite or other schools are admitted based on slot availability and evaluation of transcripts.\n* **By Academic Load:** Regular students carry the full load; Irregular students carry less than the full load; Special students do not earn formal academic credits.\n* **By Year Level:** Freshmen (First Year or <25% of units), Sophomores (2nd Year or 25-50% of units), Juniors (3rd Year or 50-75% of units), and Seniors (4th Year or >75% of units). In 5-year programs (Engineering/Architecture), a student is a \"Fifth\" year student until completing 80% of requirements.\n* **Special Needs:** The Institute provides modified facilities for students with visual, hearing, or orthopedic impairments in compliance with the Accessibility Law (Batas Pambansa Bilang 344).\n\n**Attendance Policies**\nAttendance is mandatory from the first class meeting. Absences are calculated based on class duration. A student is considered absent if they are not present within the first 1/6th of the scheduled time (e.g., after 30 minutes in a 3-hour class, or 10 minutes in a 1-hour class). Tardiness occurs if a student arrives within that first 1/6th fraction; three incidences of tardiness equal one absence. \n\nExcused absences require an excuse slip from the College Dean or a medical certificate verified by the Institute Medical Officer. Three successive unexcused absences result in a report to the Prefect of Discipline. Crucially, a student who is absent for more than 20% of the scheduled hours in a subject for the semester shall be automatically dropped from the class roll.",

If not completed within this period, the grade automatically becomes \"5.0\" (Failed). Completion of INC grades is free of charge. If the faculty member is unavailable (retired, resigned, unresponsive, or deceased), the Area Chairperson may act on the grade with the Dean's approval. A \"Dropped\" status is given if a student voluntarily withdraws at least two weeks before mid-terms or exceeds the allowable absences. \"No Credit\" (NC) is reserved for OJT, Thesis, or Special students.\n\n**Rectification of Grades**\nStudents cannot retake an examination to improve a passing grade. However, grades can be changed if a teacher made a calculation or recording error. \n1.  **Rectification Period:** Faculty can amend grades without a paper trail within 5 days after the posting deadline.\n2.  **Petition Process:** For changes requested 6 to 10 days after the deadline, a \"Petition Form for Rectification of Grade\" is required, accompanied by an affidavit, class record, and report of grades. This passes through the Department Head, Dean, VP for Academic Affairs, and finally the Institute President.\n3.  **Late Petitions:** Petitions filed after 10 days are handled by the Committee on Rectification of Grades, chaired by the Director of Instruction Services.",

A student with 5.00 grades in three courses (accumulated or otherwise) is warned. \n* **Probation:** Freshmen failing 3 or more courses (or 1/2 their load) in the first semester are placed on probation. Any student accumulating 5 failing grades is placed on probation. Probation is lifted if the student passes all subjects the following semester. Students can only be on probation twice; inability to lift the second probation renders them ineligible for enrollment.\n* **Dismissal/Non-Readmission:** Old students (except seniors) with 3 or more failures in a semester, or 5 cumulative dropped subjects, will not be readmitted. Students who fail or withdraw from the same course three times are dropped from the roll. \n* **Permanent Disqualification:** A student who obtains final grades of \"5.00\" in more than 75% of their enrolled academic units is permanently disqualified from the Institute. If the failure rate is between 40%-75%, they are dropped from their specific College.\n\n**Tenure and Residency**\n* **Regular Students:** Must finish the program within the prescribed years plus a grace period of two semesters (1 year).\n* **Working Students:** Allowed a period equivalent to 1.5 times the normal length of the program.\n* **Athletics Scholars:** Allowed 5 years for a 4-year degree, or 6 years for a 5-year degree, plus a 1-year grace period.\n\n**Leave of Absence (LOA) and Honorable Dismissal**\nStudents may apply for an LOA for non-academic/non-disciplinary reasons, normally not exceeding one academic year. An approved LOA stops the tenure clock (unless it is unofficial). Leaves beyond two years result in loss of residency status. Studying in another school during an LOA is prohibited. Honorable Dismissal is issued to students voluntarily withdrawing to transfer to another school; those issued Honorable Dismissal shall not be readmitted to EARIST.",

Pillo, requires every student to adhere to the principle: 'DO the right thing, right!' to ensure an environment conducive to academic excellence.\n\nRegarding the use of the Institute's name, logo, and seal, only official offices of the Institute are authorized to use them. Individual students or student groups are prohibited from using the EARIST name and logo on printed programs, invitations, announcements, letters, or tickets without a recommendation from their activity adviser or chairperson and approval from a duly authorized Institute Official.\n\nStudents are required to wear the prescribed uniform on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Specific exceptions and variations apply: laboratory or shop uniforms may be worn during respective periods; P.E. uniforms are permitted during P.E. classes; and NSTP (MTS/LTS/CWTS) uniforms are worn during training days. College Shirt uniforms are designated for Tuesdays and Thursdays, while Organizational Shirt uniforms are worn on Saturdays. Pregnant students may be exempted from wearing the uniform if they submit a Medical Certification to the EARIST Medical Officer for validation. Additionally, students may wear organizational shirts during the day if their recognized college-based organization is conducting an approved activity.\n\nIdentification cards (I.D.) are mandatory at all times. Entrance to the campus is denied to any student without their official I.D. In the event of a lost I.D., the student must immediately report the loss to the Security Officer, who will refer the case to the Registrar's Office. Replacement requires a notarized Affidavit of Loss, an Accomplished Clearance Form from the College Prefect of Discipline, and an Official Receipt of I.D. Replacement. Losing an I.D. carries specific disciplinary consequences: losing an I.D. for the second time without a valid reason constitutes 'negligence' (a minor offense), requiring a parent dialogue with the College Prefect of Discipline and a warning. Losing an I.D. for the third time without a valid reason constitutes 'gross negligence' (a major offense), requiring a parent dialogue and placement under Discipline Probation before a replacement is issued.",

For Major Offenses (Institute Level), the Board includes the OSAS Director (Chairman), the student's Dean, the ISG President, and the concerned CSG Governor. To ensure impartiality, the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) may appoint additional members, such as a Faculty/Employee Association representative or other school officials.\n\nCorrective measures are imposed not as retribution but as formative interventions to reform behavior. For Major Offenses, sanctions include Probation, Suspension, Dismissal/Non-Readmission/Exclusion, or Expulsion. For Minor Offenses, sanctions follow a progression: \n1. First offense: Written warning.\n2. Second offense: Written reprimand requiring a letter from parents (parents may be invited for a conference).\n3. Third offense: Charged as a major offense (if applicable) or a written reprimand requiring a mandatory parent conference.\n\nRegardless of the offense level, students and parents may be required to attend seminars, submit apology letters, undergo guidance counseling, or settle restitution for damages.\n\nThe Handbook mandates specific Rules of Procedure for hearings. A complaint may be filed by any EARIST community member or via an incident report from the Security Office. The accused student has specific rights:\n1. To be informed in writing of the nature of the accusation.\n2. To be informed of the evidence against them.\n3. To answer allegations and present counter-evidence with the assistance of an adviser or counsel.\n4. All evidence must be under oath and notarized. \nDecisions are rendered by school authorities upon evaluation of the evidence.",

It is given for the first and second incident of a minor offense.\n2. **Suspension:** Bars a student from class or school for a specific period. Suspensions over three days require VPAA approval. Time lost is considered a voluntary absence.\n3. **Probation:** A status for students whose behavior merits separation but are given a chance.\n   - *Academic Probation:* Imposed for failing 1 major or 2 minor courses. Lasts one semester; lifted upon passing all courses. Further failure results in non-readmission.\n   - *Discipline Probation:* Imposed for a major offense or three minor offenses. Lasts 60 school days to one semester. A student may only be placed on probation twice before dismissal.\n4. **Non-Readmission:** Allows a student with a major offense to finish the current semester but disqualifies them from enrolling in the next. This automatically disqualifies the student from receiving a Certificate of Good Moral Character.\n5. **Dismissal:** Immediate exclusion from school rolls for students guilty of major offenses where urgency is required. It includes the issuance of transfer credentials and denial of Good Moral Character.\n6. **Expulsion:** An extreme penalty excluding the student from admission to *any* public or private school in the Philippines. This requires Board of Trustees (BOT) approval. Preventive suspension may be applied during investigation if the student poses a risk.\n7. **Sanctions on Graduating Students:** Those who commit major offenses will not be allowed to join commencement exercises and will be denied a Certificate of Good Moral Character.\n\nThe school retains the right to take action against violators as long as they are enrolled (Prescriptive Period). Other penalties may include fines, revocation of degree, withholding of diploma, or annotation of the offense on the transcript.",

Psychological problems are referred directly to the Counseling and Testing Office upon the recommendation of the College Dean or OSAS.\n2.  **Filing of Complaints:** If the issue is not resolved at the consultation stage, complaints must be filed in writing. \n    * **Minor Offenses:** Filed with the Office of the Dean.\n    * **Major Offenses:** Filed with the Director of Student Affairs and Services (OSAS).\n    * **Student vs. Faculty/Personnel:** Referred by the OSAS Director to the Vice President for Academic Affairs (for academic concerns) or the Vice President for Administration and Finance (for administrative concerns).\n    * **Faculty/Personnel vs. Student:** Referred to the College Discipline Board or Institutional Discipline Board.\n3.  **Right to Counsel:** In disciplinary proceedings, both complainants and respondents have the right to counsel of their choice and the right to present affidavits to support their claims or defenses.\n4.  **Arbitration and Investigation:** The unit receiving the complaint aims for arbitration and amicable settlement. If this fails, the case is referred to the EARIST Grievance Committee for proper investigation. The Committee submits recommendations to the Institute President.\n5.  **Final Decision:** The decision of the Institute President is final and executory unless appealed to the Board of Trustees (BOT). The BOT's decision is final, without prejudice to Civil Service Law provisions.",
