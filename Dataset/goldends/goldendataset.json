    "context": "At EARIST, the process for Admission is designed for external student clients (G2C) and is managed by the Admission Services office to allow students to apply for their chosen academic programs. To initiate the admission process, a student must first undergo a preliminary assessment where screening officers determine available slots and verify mandatory requirements. This initial screening takes approximately 5 minutes and involves no fees. The student must prepare a comprehensive set of documents: 1 Copy of Original Form 138 (Senior High School Report Card) secured from their Previous Senior High School; 1 Copy of the Original Certificate of Good Moral Character from their Previous Senior High School or College; 1 Copy of the Original Certificate of Live Birth (Photocopy) from the PSA/NSO; 1 Copy of Original Transfer Credentials or Honorable Dismissal from their Previous College/University; 1 Copy of Original Copy of Grades from their Previous College/University; and a Personal Data Form which is secured directly from the EARIST Admission Services office. Under the supervision of the Chief of Admission Services, staff will then issue the ECAT Form, a process taking 15 minutes. Following this, the staff provides the student with their specific examination date, time, and permit within 5 minutes. On the designated Examination Day, the student must bring the ECAT Form, a Mongol 2 Pencil, and 2 pieces of scratch paper to the Guidance Office. The Staff of the Guidance Office facilitates the examination, which lasts 2 hours. Subsequently, the Staff and Chief of Admission Services handle the checking of examinations and the releasing of results over a period of 2 days. For those who pass, a 30-minute Personal Interview is conducted by the EARIST College Deans. Qualified students then proceed to a Physical Examination conducted by the Chief of Medical and Dental Services, lasting 1 hour. The final step involves the filling and processing of admission documents by the Chief of Admission Services, taking 5 minutes. The total estimated processing time for the entire admission cycle is 2 days and 4 hours, with no fees charged to the applicant.",

Classified as a Government to Citizen (G2C) transaction, this service facilitates the entry of external clients into the academic system. To begin, students must secure several requirements: the 'Approved and accomplished applications for admission' from the College Dean; 'Form 138' or 'Transcript of Records/Certification of Grades' from their previous school; and a 'Certificate of Good Moral Character' with a school dry seal. Transferees must also provide 'Transfer Credentials or Honorable Dismissal'. Freshmen who graduated in a different year than their application may need a certification that their F-137 was not forwarded to other SUCs. Other vital documents include a PSA-authenticated Birth Certificate, a Marriage Certificate for married females (from the PSA), and a 'Voluntary Opt-Out Form' from SRRMS for those choosing to pay tuition. The process starts with a qualifying exam (1 hour 30 mins) and a college interview conducted by the College Dean or Enrollment Officer. Accepted students then undergo medical processing at the Medical and Dental Services (1 hour, fee of 550.00). Next, students submit original credentials to the SRRMS Frontliners for a 5-minute verification; if incomplete, a promissory note is signed. Students may purchase an enrollment envelope at the IGP (25.00). The College Enrollment Officers then assist in subject enlisting, student number assignment, and scholarship tagging (10 minutes). Finally, the enrollment is validated; those opting out pay at the Cashier, and the Certificate of Registration (COR) is reflected on the student portal. The total estimated time is 3 hours and 15 minutes, excluding external factors like queues or connectivity.",

    "context": "At EARIST, undergraduate students wishing to discontinue their enrollment or drop specific subjects must follow a set procedure through the SRRMS. It is critical to note that 'Withdrawal of Registration' must be completed within two (2) weeks from the first day of regular classes, while 'Dropping Forms' must be completed before the scheduled Midterm Examination. Requirements include a 'Withdrawal Form' or 'Dropping Form' (from the Registrar's Office), a 'Letter of Intent' with a Parent's or Guardian's signature, and an 'Official Receipt' (from the Cashier's Office). The student first presents the Letter of Intent (with parent signature and Dean's approval) to the SRRMS Frontliners, who issue a payment slip (2 minutes). The student then pays a fee of 80.00 at the Cashier's Office (3 minutes). Upon presenting the receipt back to the Registrar, the Frontliner issues the specific form (Withdrawal Form if within 2 weeks of classes, or Dropping Form if before midterms) (1 minute). Once the student submits the accomplished form, SRRMS Evaluators finalize the withdrawal or drop in the system (2 minutes). The total process time is 8 minutes. This administrative process ensures that student records accurately reflect their current enrollment status and academic load.",

Withdrawal must happen within the first two weeks of classes, and dropping must occur before midterms. Needed documents include the 'Withdrawal/Dropping Form' from the Registrar, a 'School ID', a 'Letter of Intent', and an 'Official Receipt'. The student presents the Letter of Intent to the SRRMS Frontliners for a payment slip (2 minutes). They pay 80.00 at the Cashier (3 minutes) and return to the Registrar's Office. The Frontliner then issues the appropriate form (1 minute). A critical unique step for this group is that the form must be signed by all concerned faculty and the College Dean (2 minutes). Once fully signed, the student submits the form back to the Registrar's Office. After SRRMS processes the request, the student must proceed to the Accounting/FMS Office to process the refund of fees, as per the 2021 Student Handbook (2 minutes).
