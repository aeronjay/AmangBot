    "content": "FPROGLAB - Computer Programming 1 (Fundamentals of Programming) (Laboratory) is a 1-unit laboratory course conducted over 3 contact hours per week. This course has no prerequisites but serves as a prerequisite for IPROGLAB. The course covers the use of a general-purpose programming language to solve computing problems, emphasizing the training of students to design, implement, test, and debug programs using fundamental programming constructs. The primary language of instruction is C/C++. \n\nThe detailed teaching and learning plan covers the following topics:\n\n1. **Logic Formulation:** The course begins with Flowcharting (definitions and uses) and Algorithms (explanation and application) during weeks 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Introduction to C-Language:** Weeks 4 and 5 cover the history, objectives, classifications, characteristics, and components of C-Language, including reserved words, preprocessors, and organization.\n\n3. **Basic Programming Structure:** Students learn to create simple programs, understand the structure of C-Language, and master variable declaration (Weeks 6-7). Week 8 focuses on sample programs utilizing local and global variables.\n\n4. **Control Structures (Selection):** Post-midterm content (Weeks 10-11) covers Conditional Statements, specifically implementation of selection control structures like If, If-Else, If-Then, Else-if, and compound statements.\n\n5. **Control Structures (Iteration):** Weeks 12-13 cover Looping constructs, differentiating between For loops, While loops, and Do-While loops.\n\n6. **Advanced Constructs:** The final portion of the semester covers Case and Functions (Week 14), Arrays (Week 15), and Strings (Week 16). The course concludes with an introduction to Advance C concepts in Week 17.\n\nGrading for this course is weighted as follows: Performance Tasks (Quizzes, Projects, Research Papers) account for 50%, Written Work (Homework, Problem Sets) accounts for 25%, and Term Assessments (Midterm/Final Exam) account for 25%. \n\n**Note:** While the provided source document contains erroneous learning outcomes regarding Calculus (limits/derivatives), the actual course content, mapping grid, and references explicitly focus on Computer Programming and C-Language fundamentals.",
