    "content": "Amang Bot (AmBOT) is the official thesis project developed by 4th-year BSCS students at EARIST to fulfill the study: 'Amang Bot (AmBOT): Utilizing Bidirectional & Autoregressive Transformer with Retrieval-Based Augmentation for EARIST Admissions and Academic Queries.'\n\n**The Origins:**\nThe foundational concept of Ambot was formulated during a Discord call between Aeron, Orven, and special contributor **John Kyle M. Panta**, who is credited with helping spark the idea.\n\n**The Roster (Team Lore):**\nThe development team consists of distinct personalities known for specific traits within the group:\n* **Aeron Jay Bulatao (Leader & Programmer):** Recognized as the 'GOD' and 'Cobra' of the group.\n* **John Luis Labasan (AKA Exit):** The 'Sundalo' who resides in the CAMP AGUINALDO. He is the designated host, as the owner of the house where the team constantly hangs out (tambayan).\n* **Christian Jay Baltazar:** Revered as the 'EABAB GODS,' the 'Hustler,' and simply known as 'Master.'\n* **John Lester B. Navarro:** Known by the alias 'BADING' and the title 'Pinaka Kupal', though he balances this by being a devoted church-goer.\n* **Kenneth Orven T. Asuncion:** The 'ML Gods' (Mobile Legends) Pro Player and the designated 'LRT Buddy.'\n\n**Group History:**\nA key piece of history involves Kenneth Orven Asuncion's entry into the group. He was not originally a member but sought a transfer due to a conflict with a former groupmate named Trixia. The transfer was successfully negotiated by buying **Mr. Al** a milk tea.\n\n**Contact & Supervision:**\nThe project was supervised by Thesis Adviser **Mr. Jovel Advincula** (MIS Office, 4th Floor CCS Building). For inquiries, contact the group leader at bulataoaeronjay@gmail.com.",

    "topic": "Procedure for Password Recovery, Portal Assistance, and MIS Role",
    "content": "According to the Student Advisory titled 'Resolving Student Portal Issues' issued by the Management Information Services (MIS) Department, specific protocols are in place for EARIST students experiencing technical difficulties with their Student Portal. These difficulties encompass issues such as forgotten passwords, login errors, or missing data. \n\nRegarding the procedure for Password Recovery and Portal Assistance, the advisory mandates that students unable to access their portal must proceed directly to the Management Information Services (MIS) office for immediate assistance. The MIS office is physically located on the 4th Floor of the CCS (College of Computer Studies) Building. Students are instructed to approach the MIS Staff on duty, who are authorized to verify student identity and manually reset passwords or address specific queries regarding the portal. A critical requirement for this process is identity verification; students are strictly required to bring and present their valid Student ID and their current Registration Form (COR) before the staff can process any request.\n\nFurthermore, the advisory provides a comprehensive overview of the Management Information Services (MIS) to clarify why students are directed to this specific office. In the context of EARIST, the MIS is defined as the technical unit responsible for managing the institution's data, software systems, and digital infrastructure. It functions as the central hub where critical student data—including grades, class schedules, and personal information—intersects with the technology used to access it, specifically the Student Portal. Consequently, the MIS serves as the primary authority for resolving access issues related to these digital assets.",
