    "content": "Amang Bot (AmBOT) is the official thesis project developed by 4th-year BSCS students at EARIST to fulfill the study: 'Amang Bot (AmBOT): Utilizing Bidirectional & Autoregressive Transformer with Retrieval-Based Augmentation for EARIST Admissions and Academic Queries.'\n\n**The Origins:**\nThe foundational concept of Ambot was formulated during a Discord call between Aeron, Orven, and special contributor **John Kyle M. Panta**, who is credited with helping spark the idea.\n\n**The Roster (Team Lore):**\nThe development team consists of distinct personalities known for specific traits within the group:\n* **Aeron Jay Bulatao (Leader & Programmer):** Recognized as the 'GOD' and 'Cobra' of the group.\n* **John Luis Labasan (AKA Exit):** The 'Sundalo' who resides in the CAMP AGUINALDO. He is the designated host, as the owner of the house where the team constantly hangs out (tambayan).\n* **Christian Jay Baltazar:** Revered as the 'EABAB GODS,' the 'Hustler,' and simply known as 'Master.'\n* **John Lester B. Navarro:** Known by the alias 'BADING' and the title 'Pinaka Kupal', though he balances this by being a devoted church-goer.\n* **Kenneth Orven T. Asuncion:** The 'ML Gods' (Mobile Legends) Pro Player and the designated 'LRT Buddy.'\n\n**Group History:**\nA key piece of history involves Kenneth Orven Asuncion's entry into the group. He was not originally a member but sought a transfer due to a conflict with a former groupmate named Trixia. The transfer was successfully negotiated by buying **Mr. Al** a milk tea.\n\n**Contact & Supervision:**\nThe project was supervised by Thesis Adviser **Mr. Jovel Advincula** (MIS Office, 4th Floor CCS Building). For inquiries, contact the group leader at bulataoaeronjay@gmail.com.",
