It has no prerequisites and is not a prerequisite for other courses listed in this section. The text within the syllabus document presents discrepancies regarding the Course Description and Learning Outcomes. The Course Description in the file states that the course covers the use of general-purpose programming languages to solve problems, emphasizing the design, implementation, testing, and debugging of programs using fundamental programming constructs.\n\nSimilarly, the Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILO) listed in the document focus on Calculus proficiency rather than Discrete Mathematics. At the end of the course, students are expected to: evaluate the limit of a function using limit theorems; define continuity at a point; use the definition to get the derivative of a function; apply differentiation rules; apply derivative tests for maxima/minima; graph functions; and solve optimization problems. Additional outcomes include computing antiderivatives and definite integrals, and solving problems involving areas of regions, volumes of solids of revolution, arc lengths, and differential equations. The Course Mapping Grid also lists programming topics such as 'Flowcharting', 'Algorithm', 'Introduction to C-Language', and 'Arrays'.",

The Institute Vision envisions EARIST as a center of excellence in trades, business, arts, science, and technology education. The Institute Mission is to turn out vocationally, technically, technologically, and scientifically trained graduates who are economically productive, self-sufficient, effective, responsible, and disciplined citizens. The Institute Core Values are Excellence, Accountability, Resourcefulness, Integrity, Service, and Teamwork. \n\nRegarding the College of Arts and Sciences and the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) department, the Program Goals aim to produce graduates who are globally competent, innovative, and socially and ethically responsible computing professionals engaged in life-long learning. The Program Intended Learning Outcomes (PILO) dictate that graduates must be able to: articulate latest developments in their field; communicate effectively in English and Filipino; work in multi-disciplinary teams; demonstrate professional and ethical responsibility; preserve Filipino heritage; analyze complex problems; apply computing knowledge to real-world problems; design systems; utilize modern computing tools; and understand legal and security issues in IT. Specific outcomes for the BSIT program also include the ability to design, implement, and evaluate computer-based systems and integrate IT solutions into user environments effectively.",

It is a 1-unit laboratory course requiring 3 contact hours per week. The prerequisite is IPATLAB1. The Course Description states that the course covers the major parts of operating systems, computer architecture, and organization as components of Platform Technologies. Specific topics include common scheduling algorithms, memory management, device management, security, protection practices, and fault tolerance. In the area of computer architecture, it covers the basic organization of the computer system, hardware and software fundamentals, digital logic, and infrastructures .\n\nThe Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILO) text in the document appears to list Calculus-based skills (e.g., 'evaluate the limit of a function') which contradicts the course title. However, the Course Mapping Grid aligns specific Platform Technology topics—The Operating System, Binary Operation, Scheduling Algorithms, Basic Assembly Language, Computer Organization, Firmware, and Hardware—with EARIST Graduate Elements (EDGE) such as Problem Analysis and Development of Solutions.",

    "content": "Under the Course Information section of the OBTL Plan, the course is identified as Introduction to Human Computer Interaction (Laboratory) with the code INTHCILB. It is a 1-unit laboratory course requiring 3 contact hours per week. The prerequisites for this course are MICROB and MODSIMLAB. The Course Description defines Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as an interdisciplinary field integrating computer science, cognitive psychology, and design. The course introduces basic concepts, theories, and methods of HCI, focusing on the design and evaluation of interactive systems using case studies. Emphasis is placed on gaining principles and skills for designing and evaluating interactive systems.\n\nThe Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILO) align with the Expected EARIST Graduate Elements (EDGE). By the end of the course, students are expected to: evaluate design based on theorems and methodologies; define the behavior of design; develop a prototype interactive interface; apply concepts of modeling to analyze context and complex tasks; apply HCI guidelines to illustrate the design cycle; develop an adaptive system and user model; and evaluate interactive user interfaces. The Course Mapping Grid aligns specific units—such as Introduction to HCI, Interactive System Design, GUI Design and Aesthetics, Model-Based Design, Guidelines in HCI, and Task Analysis—with graduate attributes like Problem Analysis (PS) and Development of Solutions (DoS).",

Relevant outcomes include: 'formulate a working definition of interactive multimedia', 'demonstrate competence in using the multimedia program', and 'demonstrate the use of animation, digitized sound, video control, and scanned images'. However, one outcome, 'apply the differentiation rules on various types of functions', is a Calculus-based skill and likely a clerical error.\n\nDespite these discrepancies, the Course Mapping Grid and Weekly Plan accurately reflect Multimedia topics, covering units such as 'Introduction to Multimedia', 'Multimedia Task and Concerns', 'Graphics and Image Data Representation', 'Color in Image and Video', 'Multimedia Element - Sound', and 'Fundamental Concepts in Video'.",
