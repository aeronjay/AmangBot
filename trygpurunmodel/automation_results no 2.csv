1. **Notarized Parental Waivers:** For any off-campus event involving minors, notarized parental waivers must be obtained. This helps ensure that parents are aware of the activity and give their consent for their child's participation.
2. **Faculty Adviser's Letter of Conformity:** Your organization must have a faculty adviser who is a full-time faculty member with at least one year of residency. The adviser is responsible for ensuring that the activity complies with CHED requirements and is attended by the faculty adviser. If the adviser is unavailable, a replacement must be reported to the OSAS two days prior. The ideal ratio is one faculty adviser or guardian for every 30 or fewer student participants.
3. **Compliance with CHED Requirements:** Off-campus events must comply with the requirements set forth by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). This includes ensuring that the activity is safe, organized, and supervised by responsible adults.
4. **Attendance by the Faculty Advisor:** The faculty adviser must attend the off-campus event to ensure that it runs smoothly and that students are safe. If the adviser is unable to attend, a replacement must be reported to the OSAS two days prior.

1. Must be a bonafide undergraduate student.
2. Must meet the SCUAA age limit.
3. Must have no failed grades in the previous semester.

Since you have an excellent GWA (2.0) and you did fail one class last year, it seems that you meet the first two requirements. However, you mentioned that you failed one class last year. This means that you have a failing grade (INC or DROPS) on your record.

According to the Student Handbook 2021, Section 3 - Grading System, Incomplete (INC) and Dropped (DROPS) grades are temporary grades given for unfulfilled requirements or voluntary withdrawal. If you have an INC or DROPS grade, you will need to complete it within the next two semesters using SARRMS Form No. 006. If you are unable to complete the requirements within this time frame, the grade will automatically become ""5.0"" (Failed).

Since you have an INC or DROPS grade on your record, it is important to make sure that you complete the requirements within the next two semesters. If you are unable to complete the requirements, you may not be eligible to run for student council.

It's also worth noting that running for student council can be a significant commitment, and it's important to make sure that you have the time and resources to dedicate to the role.

However, if you have a part-time job and would like to enroll in fewer than 18 units, you may need to apply for an overload or cross-enrollment.

To apply for an overload, you will need to obtain an Accomplished Application Form and a Withdrawal/Changing/Adding Form from SRRMS, as well as an evaluation from your Area Chairperson.

1. **Timeframe:** Dismissal is an immediate exclusion from school rolls, while expulsion is a more extreme penalty that excludes the student from admission to any public or private school in the Philippines.
2. **Board of Trustees (BOT) involvement:** Expulsion requires BOT approval, whereas dismissal does not.

4. **Prescriptive Period:** The school retains the right to take action against violators as long as they are enrolled (Prescriptive Period). Other penalties may include fines, revocation of degree, withholding of diploma, or annotation of the offense on the transcript.

The clinic also offers pre-enrollment health assessments for first-year students and transferees, which include a Chest X-ray, a 20-minute interview and assessment, a 30-minute consultation where the Medical Officer reviews the X-ray results, and registration in the logbook.

2. Obtain the SAS Accreditation Form from the SAS Office.
3. Submit a Letter of Application for Recognition, the Constitution and By-Laws of the Organization, an Organization Profile, and a List of Officers (including specimen signatures, student numbers, and 2x2 ID photos) to the ISG for initial evaluation.
4. The ISG will log and submit the evaluated documents to the SAS Staff.
5. The Program Head of the Leadership Division will evaluate the submission and issue findings for further compliance if necessary.
6. After complying with any lacking requirements, the SAS Staff and Program Head will perform a final evaluation and print the Certificate of Accreditation.
7. The accreditation will then be endorsed to the SAS Director and VPAA for the Institute President's approval.

According to the EARIST Student Handbook 2021, Section 8 through 10, off-campus events and overnight activities require approval from the Office of Student Affairs (OSAS). To ensure the safety and well-being of students, there are several special requirements that your organization must follow:

1. **Notarized Parental Waivers:** For any off-campus event involving minors, notarized parental waivers must be obtained. This helps ensure that parents are aware of the activity and give their consent for their child's participation.
2. **Faculty Adviser's Letter of Conformity:** Your organization must have a faculty adviser who is a full-time faculty member with at least one year of residency. The adviser is responsible for ensuring that the activity complies with CHED requirements and is attended by the faculty adviser. If the adviser is unavailable, a replacement must be reported to the OSAS two days prior. The ideal ratio is one faculty adviser or guardian for every 30 or fewer student participants.
3. **Compliance with CHED Requirements:** Off-campus events must comply with the requirements set forth by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). This includes ensuring that the activity is safe, organized, and supervised by responsible adults.
4. **Attendance by the Faculty Advisor:** The faculty adviser must attend the off-campus event to ensure that it runs smoothly and that students are safe. If the adviser is unable to attend, a replacement must be reported to the OSAS two days prior.

To hold an off-campus event, your organization will need to submit a request to the OSAS, along with the necessary documents, such as a notarized parental waiver, a faculty adviser's letter of conformity, and a project proposal. The OSAS will review the request and ensure that it meets all the necessary requirements before approving the event.

1. Must be a bonafide undergraduate student.
2. Must meet the SCUAA age limit.
3. Must have no failed grades in the previous semester.

Since you have an excellent GWA (2.0) and you did fail one class last year, it seems that you meet the first two requirements. However, you mentioned that you failed one class last year. This means that you have a failing grade (INC or DROPS) on your record.

According to the Student Handbook 2021, Section 3 - Grading System, Incomplete (INC) and Dropped (DROPS) grades are temporary grades given for unfulfilled requirements or voluntary withdrawal. If you have an INC or DROPS grade, you will need to complete it within the next two semesters using SARRMS Form No. 006. If you are unable to complete the requirements within this time frame, the grade will automatically become ""5.0"" (Failed).

Since you have an INC or DROPS grade on your record, it is important to make sure that you complete the requirements within the next two semesters. If you are unable to complete the requirements, you may not be eligible to run for student council.

It's also worth noting that running for student council can be a significant commitment, and it's important to make sure that you have the time and resources to dedicate to the role.

You will then need to submit a Letter of Request recommending approval by the concerned program chairperson to the College Dean's Office. The Program Chairperson and College Dean will review your concern and academic standing to provide the necessary recommendation.

Alternatively, you may be able to apply for cross-enrollment if the subject you wish to enroll in is not a major subject, is not offered at the University, or belongs to an old curriculum. To do this, you will need to follow the procedures outlined in the SARMS Manual, which requires recommendation by the Dean, notation by the University Registrar, and approval by the VP for Academic Affairs.

It's important to note that overloading is strictly prohibited for delinquent students and Education students undergoing Practice Teaching. Additionally, if you fail an overloaded subject, you cannot overload in the subsequent semester.

Here are the steps you should take:

1. **Prepare the necessary documents:** You will need to prepare a 'Letter of Intent' with a Parent's or Guardian's signature, an 'EARIST School ID', and obtain an 'LOA Form' and 'Official Receipt'.

3. Not have a failing grade or dropped subject in the previous semester.

1. **Timeframe:** Dismissal is an immediate exclusion from school rolls, while expulsion is a more extreme penalty that excludes the student from admission to any public or private school in the Philippines.
2. **Board of Trustees (BOT) involvement:** Expulsion requires BOT approval, whereas dismissal does not.
3. **Certificate of Good Moral Character:** Students who are dismissed or expelled will not be allowed to join commencement exercises and will be denied a Certificate of Good Moral Character.
4. **Prescriptive Period:** The school retains the right to take action against violators as long as they are enrolled (Prescriptive Period). Other penalties may include fines, revocation of degree, withholding of diploma, or annotation of the offense on the transcript.

I'm AmBOT, your helpful student assistant at EARIST. I'd be happy to help you with your question about off-campus events for your student organization.

According to the EARIST Student Handbook 2021, Section 8 through 10, off-campus events and overnight activities require approval from the Office of Student Affairs (OSAS). To ensure the safety and well-being of students, there are several special requirements that your organization must follow:

1. **Notarized Parental Waivers:** For any off-campus event involving minors, notarized parental waivers must be obtained. This helps ensure that parents are aware of the activity and give their consent for their child's participation.
2. **Faculty Adviser's Letter of Conformity:** Your organization must have a faculty adviser who is a full-time faculty member with at least one year of residency. The adviser is responsible for ensuring that the activity complies with CHED requirements and is attended by the faculty adviser. If the adviser is unavailable, a replacement must be reported to the OSAS two days prior. The ideal ratio is one faculty adviser or guardian for every 30 or fewer student participants.
3. **Compliance with CHED Requirements:** Off-campus events must comply with the requirements set forth by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). This includes ensuring that the activity is safe, organized, and supervised by responsible adults.
4. **Attendance by the Faculty Advisor:** The faculty adviser must attend the off-campus event to ensure that it runs smoothly and that students are safe. If the adviser is unable to attend, a replacement must be reported to the OSAS two days prior.

To hold an off-campus event, your organization will need to submit a request to the OSAS, along with the necessary documents, such as a notarized parental waiver, a faculty adviser's letter of conformity, and a project proposal. The OSAS will review the request and ensure that it meets all the necessary requirements before approving the event.
