5,What is the three-level screening process for applicants?,"Level 1: EARISTCAT (Admission Test), Level 2: College Interview, and Level 3: Program Preparedness Test (PPT).",earist_handbook_2021_screening_process_levels," Hello! I'm AmBOT, your helpful student assistant at EARIST. I'd be happy to help you understand the three-level screening process for applicants.

According to the EARIST Student Handbook 2021, the three-level screening process for applicants is as follows:

1. **Screening Level 1: EARIST College Admission Test (EARISTCAT):** This is the first level of the screening process, and it involves an examination administered by the Guidance and Counseling Office of the Student Affairs Services (SAS) in coordination with Management Information System and Technology Services (MISTS). The transmutation formula for EARISTCAT scores is: EARISTCAT Rating = (Total Score x 50 / No. Of Items) + 50.
2. **Screening Level 2: College Admission Interview:** This interview helps the institution assess the candidate's leadership potential, determination, perseverance, career choice, and communication skills. The interviewer is the chairperson or a faculty member of the program applied for. For Architecture and Fine Arts applicants, a Drawing Ability Test (DAT) is conducted as part of this level. Each college defines its own evaluation rubric, and the interviewer's evaluation is final and unappealable.
3. **Screening Level 3: Program Preparedness Test (PPT):** These are placement examinations designed to assess competency in specific skills or disciplines. The PPT is required for the following programs: BS Architecture, BS Applied Physics, BS Mathematics, BS Computer Science, BS Information Technology, BS Psychology, BS Civil Engineering, BS Chemical Engineering, BS Computer Engineering, BS Electronics and Communications Engineering, BS Electrical Engineering, and BS Mechanical Engineering.

Students who score lower than the pre-determined cut-off in the PPT may be conditionally admitted. These conditionally admitted students must undergo an Enhancement Program, requiring them to enroll in and pass one to two enhancement courses during their first year. The Handbook specifies that applicants who do not meet the score requirements for their first-choice program will be advised to apply for their second choice.

I hope this information helps you understand the three-level screening process for applicants at EARIST. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask!","[1] Student Handbook 2021 (ID: earist_handbook_2021_screening_process_levels): Under Article I Admission Policy, the EARIST Student Handbook 2021 mandates a three-level screening ...

To apply, you must submit the necessary documents, such as a Notice of Admission or ECAT Result, an Accomplished Application Form, and a Letter of Request recommending approval.

Once your application is complete, it will undergo an evaluation process, which may involve an interview, assessment, or cross-registration. The processing time for this segment of enrollment varies depending on the college and program, but it typically takes between 1 and 2 days.

I'm AmBOT, your friendly student assistant at EARIST. I'd be happy to help you with your question about completing an 'Incomplete' (INC) grade.

First, let me clarify that an 'Incomplete' grade is a temporary grade given when a student has not fulfilled certain requirements. To complete an INC grade, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Submit the SARRMS Form No. 006:** The first step is to submit the SARRMS Form No. 006 to your faculty member. This form will help your faculty member track your progress and ensure that you have completed the necessary requirements to clear the INC grade.
2. **Complete the requirements:** Once your faculty member has reviewed your form, they will provide you with a list of requirements that you need to complete to clear the INC grade. These requirements may include attending additional classes, completing assignments, or taking exams.
3. **Submit the completed requirements:** After completing the requirements, you will need to submit them to your faculty member. They will review your submission and, if everything is in order, they will clear the INC grade on your academic record.

It's important to note that if your faculty member is unavailable, the Area Chairperson may act on the grade with the Dean's approval. Additionally, if you are unable to complete the requirements within the specified timeframe, the INC grade will automatically become a ""5.0"" (Failed) grade.

If you're interested in shifting to another program at EARIST, the process is called ""enrollment for shifters."" This is managed by the Student Registration and Records Management Services (SRRMS).

To begin, you'll need to obtain an 'Academic Program Evaluation' from the Registrar's Office, a 'Shifter's Form' also from the Registrar, and a 'Voluntary Opt-Out Form' from SRRMS if applicable. You can visit the College to obtain the Shifter's Form, where the College Dean provides guidance. The College Dean will sign the form, and you'll need to have it signed by both the previous and accepting Deans.

Next, you'll submit the accomplished form to the Registrar's Office, where Frontliners will verify signatures and update your program curriculum. After that, you'll proceed to your new college, where the Enrollment Officer will assist in subject selection based on the APE. During this step, the officer will discuss the opt-out option and provide the form if chosen. The enrollment will then be validated, and the Certificate of Registration (COR) will be generated on the student portal. If fees are applicable, you'll pay 40.00 at the Cashier. Finally, you'll visit the Registrar for ID validation, where a sticker will be affixed to your student ID.

The total turnaround time for this process is approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes, subject to office volume and connectivity.

47,What happens if a student fails a course three times?,They are dropped from the roll.,earist_handbook_2021_retention_tenure_scholastic_delinquency," I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with a course. Failing a course three times can have different consequences depending on the specific circumstances and policies of your school.

According to the Student Handbook 2021, if a student fails or withdraws from the same course three times, they will be dropped from the roll. This means they will no longer be enrolled in that course and may need to find an alternative course or program to complete their degree requirements.

It's important to note that this policy is in place to ensure that students are making progress towards their academic goals and not simply repeating the same course without addressing the underlying issues. If you're struggling with a particular course, I recommend reaching out to your academic advisor or the instructor for additional support and guidance. They may be able to provide additional resources or accommodations to help you succeed in the course.

Additionally, if you're concerned about your overall academic performance, you may want to consider seeking academic support services, such as tutoring or academic coaching, to help you improve your grades and better understand the material. These services are typically available through your school's Student Affairs and Services (SAS) office.

Remember, failing a course is not the end of the road. With the right support and resources, you can overcome these challenges and continue making progress towards your academic goals.","[1] Student Handbook 2021 (ID: earist_handbook_2021_retention_tenure_scholastic_delinquency): Under Article II Academic Policies, the EARIST Student Handbook 2021 enforces strict Retention Polic...

Based on my data from the EARIST Student Handbook 2021 and the EARIST Citizen's Charter 2025, the 'APE' in the shifting process stands for 'Academic Program Evaluation.' It is a requirement for continuing irregular students, returnees, shifters, and transferring students during the enrollment process. The APE evaluates the student's academic standing and determines the necessary subjects they need to complete their program.

During the shifting process, the student first applies for the APE at the Registrar's Office. After paying the 40.00 fee, the student submits the receipt to SRRMS to receive a claim stub. Internal evaluators then perform a grade evaluation to determine the needed subjects. Once the results are released, the student goes to their College for subject enlisting and potential opt-out discussion.

It's important to note that EARIST offers various scholarships and financial assistance programs, including the Tertiary Education Program, Tulong Dunong Program, and Faculty and Employees Union Scholarship, as well as cross-enrollment procedures for specific courses not offered at the Institute.
