What is the three-level screening process for applicants?,"Based on my data from the EARIST Student Handbook 2021, the three-level screening process for applicants at EARIST includes the following steps:

1. **Screening Level 1: EARIST College Admission Test (EARISTCAT):** This is the initial assessment stage where applicants take a standardized test to measure their aptitude and intelligence. The test is administered by the Guidance and Counseling Office in collaboration with the Office of Student Admission, Registration and Records Management Services (SARRMS) and Management Information System and Technology Services (MISTS). The scores are calculated using a transmutation formula: EARISTCAT Rating = (Total Score x 50 / No. Of Items) + 50.

2. **Screening Level 2: College Admission Interview:** After passing the EARISTCAT, applicants undergo a personal interview. The interview helps the institution evaluate the candidate's leadership potential, determination, perseverance, career choice, and communication skills. The interviewer is typically the chairperson or a faculty member of the program applied for. For Architecture and Fine Arts applicants, a Drawing Ability Test (DAT) is conducted as part of this level. Each college defines its own evaluation rubric, and the interviewer's evaluation is final and unappealable.

3. **Screening Level 3: Program Preparedness Test (PPT):** This is the final assessment stage where applicants demonstrate their competency in specific skills or disciplines required for their chosen program. The PPT is mandatory for various programs, including Architecture, Applied Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Information Technology, Psychology, Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electronics and Communications Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Students who do not meet the pre-determined cut-off score in the PPT may be conditionally admitted and required to enroll in and pass one to two enhancement courses during their first year.

What happens if my PPT score is below 50.00% for Architecture?,"Based on my data from the Student Handbook 2021, if your Program Preparedness Test (PPT) score for Architecture is below 50.00%, you will fall under the Realignment category. This means that you may not be able to enroll in the Bachelor of Science in Architecture program directly. Instead, you will be advised to apply for a different program.

However, there is an opportunity for you to improve your skills and potentially meet the requirements for your first-choice program. Students who score lower than the cut-off in the PPT may be conditionally admitted. These conditionally admitted students must undergo an Enhancement Program, requiring them to enroll in and pass one to two enhancement courses during their first year.

I would recommend reaching out to the Office of Student Affairs (OSAS) or the College of Architecture and Fine Arts (CAFA) for more information about the Enhancement Program and the specific courses you may need to take. They can provide you with detailed guidance and help you navigate the process.

What is the process for shifting to another program?,"Based on my data from the EARIST Citizen's Charter 2025 (1st Edition), under the Student Registration and Records Management Services (SRRMS) category, I can guide you through the process of shifting to another program at EARIST.

First, you will need to obtain an 'Academic Program Evaluation' from the Registrar's Office, a 'Shifter's Form' also from the Registrar, and a 'Voluntary Opt-Out Form' from SRRMS if applicable.

Begin by visiting the College to obtain the Shifter's Form. The College Dean will provide guidance during this step (5 minutes). Ensure that the form is signed by both the previous and accepting Deans.

Next, submit the accomplished form to the Registrar’s Office, where Frontliners will verify signatures and update your program curriculum (5 minutes). Proceed to your new college, where the Enrollment Officer will assist you in subject selection based on the Academic Program Evaluation (2 hours). During this step, the officer will discuss the opt-out option and provide the form if chosen.

Your enrollment will then be validated, and the Certificate of Registration (COR) will be generated on your student portal. If fees are applicable, pay 40.00 at the Cashier (5 minutes). The final step is visiting the Registrar for ID validation, where a sticker will be affixed to your student ID (5 minutes).

Can I take subjects in other schools (Cross-Registration)?,"Absolutely, I'd be happy to help answer your question about cross-registration at EARIST! Based on my data from the EARIST Citizen's Charter 2025 (1st Edition), cross-registration is a process that allows students to take specific subjects in other colleges or schools within the institution. This is available to both old and new students, as well as transferees and shifters.

To initiate the process, you will need to prepare an Accomplished Application Form from the SRRMS, a Chairperson’s Evaluation from your Area Chairperson, and a Letter of Request recommending approval. The process involves obtaining recommending approval from your concerned College Dean and Program Chairperson at the Dean’s Office. The staff at the Dean’s Office will assist you in processing these concerns. This procedure is streamlined to be completed within 1 day, and no fees are required for this college-level recommendation.

However, it's important to note that there are certain conditions and limitations to cross-registration. For instance, the University explicitly does not allow sit-in or tutorial classes. Additionally, the SARMS Manual establishes protocols for handling special academic requests, including cross-registration. According to the manual, cross-registration is allowed only if the student is graduating, and the subject is not a major subject, is not offered at the University, or belongs to an old curriculum.

Can I apply for a second baccalaureate degree at EARIST?,"Based on my data from the Student Handbook 2021, EARIST does not explicitly state a policy regarding the application for a second baccalaureate degree. However, I can guide you to the Office of the Registrar or the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs for more specific information. They should be able to provide you with the necessary procedures and requirements for pursuing a second degree at EARIST.

In the meantime, you may want to review the institutional goals and objectives outlined in the Student Handbook. EARIST aims to produce quality graduates who are globally competitive and man the needs of business and industry. If you believe that a second degree will help you achieve these goals, it may be worth exploring the opportunity further.

Remember, every academic institution has unique policies and procedures, so it's essential to consult the appropriate office for accurate and up-to-date information.

How do I get my first School ID?,"I'm glad you're asking about getting your first School ID at EARIST! The process is straightforward. First, you'll need to complete your enrollment procedure for the Teacher Certificate Program (TCP) or Graduate School (GS).

Specific exceptions and variations apply: laboratory or shop uniforms may be worn during respective periods; P.E. uniforms are permitted during P.E. classes; and NSTP (MTS/LTS/CWTS) uniforms are worn during training days. College Shirt uniforms are designated for Tuesdays and Thursdays, while Organizational Shirt uniforms are worn on Saturdays. Pregnant students may be exempted from wearing the uniform if they submit a Medical Certification to the EARIST Medical Officer for validation.
